38,to kill a mockingbird by harper lee
116,dedication for mr lee and alice in consideration of love affection lawyers i suppose were children once
113,charles lamb chapter  when he was nearly thirteen my brother jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow
145,when it healed and jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged he was seldom selfconscious about his injury
176,his left arm was somewhat shorter than his right when he stood or walked the back of his hand was at right angles to his body his thumb parallel to his thigh
63,he couldnt have cared less so long as he could pass and punt
139,when enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident
135,i maintain that the ewells started it all but jem who was four years my senior said it started long before that
114,he said it began the summer dill came to us when dill first gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
98,i said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing it really began with andrew jackson
153,if general jackson hadnt run the creeks up the creek simon finch would never have paddled up the alabama and where would we be if he hadnt
94,we were far too old to settle an argument with a fistfight so we consulted atticus
33,our father said we were both right
171,being southerners it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the battle of hastings
125,all we had was simon finch a furtrapping apothecary from cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess
332,in england simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren and as simon called himself a methodist he worked his way across the atlantic to philadelphia thence to jamaica thence to mobile and up the saint stephens
305,mindful of john wesleys strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling simon made a pile practicing medicine but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of god as the putting on of gold and costly apparel
253,so simon having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the alabama river some forty miles above saint stephens
128,he returned to saint stephens only once to find a wife and with her established a line that ran high to daughters
46,simon lived to an impressive age and died rich
139,it was customary for the men in the family to remain on simons homestead finchs landing and make their living from cotton
254,the place was selfsufficient modest in comparison with the empires around it the landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice wheat flour and articles of clothing supplied by riverboats from mobile
424,simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north and the south as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century when my father atticus finch went to montgomery to read law and his younger brother went to boston to study medicine
213,their sister alexandra was the finch who remained at the landing she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trotlines were full
92,when my father was admitted to the bar he returned to maycomb and began his practice
96,maycomb some twenty miles east of finchs landing was the county seat of maycomb county
147,atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack a spittoon a checkerboard and an unsullied code of alabama
87,his first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the maycomb county jail
243,atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and escape with their lives but they were haverfords in maycomb county a name synonymous with jackass
331,the haverfords had dispatched maycomb s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses and insisted that thesonofabitchhadit comingtohim was a good enough defense for anybody
292,they persisted in pleading not guilty to firstdegree murder so there was nothing much atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure an occasion that was probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminal law
200,during his first five years in maycomb atticus practiced economy more than anything for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education
242,john hale finch was ten years younger than my father and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing but after getting uncle jack started atticus derived a reasonable income from the law
228,he liked maycomb he was maycomb county born and bred he knew his people they knew him and because of simon finchs industry atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town
79,maycomb was an old town but it was a tired old town when i first knew it
122,in rainy weather the streets turned to red slop grass grew on the sidewalks the courthouse sagged in the square
190,somehow it was hotter then a black dog suffered on a summers day bony mules hitched to hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square
51,mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning
154,ladies bathed before noon after their threeoclock naps and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum
23,people moved slowly then
116,they ambled across the square shuffled in and out of the stores around it took their time about everything
51,a day was twentyfour hours long but seemed longer
162,there was no hurry for there was nowhere to go nothing to buy and no money to buy it with nothing to see outside the boundaries of maycomb county
156,but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself
102,we lived on the main residential street in town  atticus jem and i plus calpurnia our cook
121,jem and i found our father satisfactory he played with us read to us and treated us with courteous detachment
37,calpurnia was something else again
122,she was all angles and bones she was nearsighted she squinted her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard
183,she was always ordering me out of the kitchen asking me why i couldnt behave as well as jem when she knew he was older and calling me home when i wasnt ready to come
38,our battles were epic and onesided
69,calpurnia always won mainly because atticus always took her side
123,she had been with us ever since jem was born and i had felt her tyrannical presence as long as i could remember
61,our mother died when i was two so i never felt her absence
109,she was a graham from montgomery atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature
57,he was middleaged then she was fifteen years his junior
158,jem was the product of their first year of marriage four years later i was born and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack
32,they said it ran in her family
38,i did not miss her but i think jem did
154,he remembered her clearly and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length then go off and play by himself behind the carhouse
60,when he was like that i knew better than to bother him
250,when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten our summertime boundaries within calling distance of calpurnia were mrs henry lafayette duboses house two doors to the north of us and the radley place three doors to the south
37,we were never tempted to break them
164,the radley place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end mrs dubose was plain hell
37,that was the summer dill came to us
157,early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard jem and i heard something next door in miss rachel haverfords collard patch
156,we went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy  miss rachels rat terrier was expecting  instead we found someone sitting looking at us
53,sitting down he wasnt much higher than the collards
38,we stared at him until he spoke hey
35,hey yourself said jem pleasantly
34,im charles baker harris he said
48,i just thought youd like to know i can read
81,you got anything needs readin i can do it how old are you asked jem fourandahalf
13,goin on seven
60,shoot no wonder then said jem jerking his thumb at me
95,scout yonders been readin ever since she was born and she aint even started to school yet
37,you look right puny for goin on seven
31,im little but im old he said
51,jem brushed his hair back to get a better look
42,why dont you come over charles baker harris
16,lord what a name
25,s not any funniern yours
59,aunt rachel says your names jeremy atticus finch
12,jem scowled
35,im big enough to fit mine he said
29,your names longer n you are
21,bet its a foot longer
60,folks call me dill said dill struggling under the fence
57,do better if you go over it instead of under it i said
23,where d you come from
154,dill was from meridian mississippi was spending the summer with his aunt miss rachel and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on
193,his family was from maycomb county originally his mother worked for a photographer in meridian had entered his picture in a beautiful child contest and won five dollars
83,she gave the money to dill who went to the picture show twenty times on it
102,dont have any picture shows here except jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes said jem
23,ever see anything good
98,dill had seen dracula a revelation that moved jem to eye him with the beginning of respect
23,tell it to us he said
19,dill was a curiosity
179,he wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff he was a year my senior but i towered over him
180,as he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken his laugh was sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead
161,when dill reduced dracula to dust and jem said the show sounded better than the book i asked dill where his father was you aint said anything about him
16,i havent got one
51,no then if hes not dead youve got one havent you
105,dill blushed and jem told me to hush a sure sign that dill had been studied and found acceptable
54,thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment
259,routine contentment was improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard fussing running through our list of dramas based on the works of oliver optic victor appleton and edgar rice burroughs
42,in this matter we were lucky to have dill
134,he played the character parts formerly thrust upon me  the ape in tarzan mr crabtree in the rover boys mr damon in tom swift
130,thus we came to know dill as a pocket merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plans strange longings and quaint fancies
171,but by the end of august our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions and it was then that dill gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
37,the radley place fascinated dill
197,in spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water but drew him no nearer than the lightpole on the corner a safe distance from the radley gate
74,there he would stand his arm around the fat pole staring and wondering
62,the radley place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house
82,walking south one faced its porch the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot
171,the house was low was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters but had long ago darkened to the color of the slategray yard around it
94,rainrotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda oak trees kept the sun away
161,the remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard  a swept yard that was never swept  where johnson grass and rabbittobacco grew in abundance
48,inside the house lived a malevolent phantom
53,people said he existed but jem and i had never seen him
79,people said he went out at night when the moon was down and peeped in windows
85,when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap it was because he had breathed on them
70,any stealthy small crimes committed in maycomb were his work
333,once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated although the culprit was crazy addie who eventually drowned himself in barkers eddy people still looked at the radley place unwilling to discard their initial suspicions
133,a negro would not pass the radley place at night he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked
249,the maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the radley lot from the radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nuts lay untouched by the children radley pecans would kill you
82,a baseball hit into the radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked
69,the misery of that house began many years before jem and i were born
102,the radleys welcome anywhere in town kept to themselves a predilection unforgivable in maycomb
255,they did not go to church maycombs principal recreation but worshiped at home mrs radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a midmorning coffee break with her neighbors and certainly never joined a missionary circle
210,mr radley walked to town at eleventhirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries
230,i never knew how old mr radley made his living  jem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothing  but mr radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember
175,the shutters and doors of the radley house were closed on sundays another thing alien to maycombs ways closed doors meant illness and cold weather only
126,of all days sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting ladies wore corsets men wore coats children wore shoes
124,but to climb the radley front steps and call hey of a sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did
38,the radley house had no screen doors
82,i once asked atticus if it ever had any atticus said yes but before i was born
309,according to neighborhood legend when the younger radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the cunninghams from old sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in maycomb
377,they did little but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits they hung around the barbershop they rode the bus to abbottsville on sundays and went to the picture show they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling hell the dewdrop inn amp fishing camp they experimented with stumphole whiskey
103,nobody in maycomb had nerve enough to tell mr radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd
221,one night in an excessive spurt of high spirits the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver resisted arrest by maycomb s ancient beadle mr conner and locked him in the courthouse outhouse
412,the town decided something had to be done mr conner said he knew who each and every one of them was and he was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct disturbing the peace assault and battery and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female
147,the judge asked mr conner why he included the last charge mr conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in maycomb heard them
229,the judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter it was no prison and it was no disgrace
26,mr radley thought it was
102,if the judge released arthur mr radley would see to it that arthur gave no further trouble
75,knowing that mr radley s word was his bond the judge was glad to do so
200,the other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at auburn
140,the doors of the radley house were closed on weekdays as well as sundays and mr radley s boy was not seen again for fifteen years
137,but there came a day barely within jems memory when boo radley was heard from and was seen by several people but not by jem
313,he said atticus never talked much about the radleys when jem would question him atticuss only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened jem said atticus shook his head and said mm mm mm
136,so jem received most of his information from miss stephanie crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing
150,according to miss stephanie boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from the maycomb tribune to paste in his scrapbook
27,his father entered the room
146,as mr radley passed by boo drove the scissors into his parents leg pulled them out wiped them on his pants and resumed his activities
195,mrs radley ran screaming into the street that arthur was killing them all but when the sheriff arrived he found boo still sitting in the livingroom cutting up the tribune
37,he was thirtythree years old then
163,miss stephanie said old mr radley said no radley was going to any asylum when it was suggested that a season in tuscaloosa might be helpful to boo
46,boo wasnt crazy he was highstrung at times
143,it was all right to shut him up mr radley conceded but insisted that boo not be charged with anything he was not a criminal
122,the sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside negroes so boo was locked in the courthouse basement
79,boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in jems memory
154,miss stephanie crawford said some of the town council told mr radley that if he didnt take boo back boo would die of mold from the damp
70,besides boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county
171,nobody knew what form of intimidation mr radley employed to keep boo out of sight but jem figured that mr radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time
115,atticus said no it wasnt that sort of thing that there were other ways of making people into ghosts
140,my memory came alive to see mrs radley occasionally open the front door walk to the edge of the porch and pour water on her cannas
68,but every day jem and i would see mr radley walking to and from town
98,he was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes so colorless they did not reflect light
98,his cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip
169,miss stephanie crawford said he was so upright he took the word of god as his only law and we believed her because mr radleys posture was ramrod straight
21,he never spoke to us
111,when he passed we would look at the ground and say good morning sir and he would cough in reply
143,mr radleys elder son lived in pensacola he came home at christmas and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place
74,from the day mr radley took arthur home people said the house died
185,but there came a day when atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us
20,mr radley was dying
26,he took his time about it
154,wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the radley lot straw was put down on the sidewalk traffic was diverted to the back street
106,dr reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the radleys every time he called
45,jem and i crept around the yard for days
149,at last the sawhorses were taken away and we stood watching from the front porch when mr radley made his final journey past our house
131,there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia and she spat meditatively into the yard
100,we looked at her in surprise for calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people
190,the neighborhood thought when mr radley went under boo would come out but it had another think coming boos elder brother returned from pensacola and took mr radleys place
65,the only difference between him and his father was their ages
45,jem said mr nathan radley bought cotton too
149,mr nathan would speak to us however when we said good morning and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand
172,the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know the longer he would stand hugging the lightpole on the corner the more he would wonder
48,wonder what he does in there he would murmur
52,looks like hed just stick his head out the door
55,jem said he goes out all right when its pitch dark
143,miss stephanie crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her
48,said his head was like a skull lookin at her
55,aint you ever waked up at night and heard him dill
60,he walks like this jem slid his feet through the gravel
57,why do you think miss rachel locks up so tight at night
155,ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching on the back screen but he was gone time atticus got there
26,wonder what he looks like
285,jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo was about sixandahalf feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch thats why his hands were bloodstained  if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off
154,there was a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eyes popped and he drooled most of the time
38,lets try to make him come out said dill
30,id like to see what he looks like
110,jem said if dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door
169,our first raid came to pass only because dill bet jem the gray ghost against two tom swifts that jem wouldnt get any farther than the radley gate
53,in all his life jem had never declined a dare
37,jem thought about it for three days
126,i suppose he loved honor more than his head for dill wore him down easily youre scared dill said the first day
41,aint scared just respectful jem said
91,the next day dill said youre too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard
100,jem said he reckoned he wasnt hed passed the radley place every school day of his life
20,always runnin i said
200,but dill got him the third day when he told jem that folks in meridian certainly werent as afraid as the folks in maycomb that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones in maycomb
177,this was enough to make jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the lightpole watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge
123,i hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one dill harris said jem when we joined him
43,dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out
23,you started it remember
47,youre still scared murmured dill patiently
175,jem wanted dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything its just that i cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us
46,besides jem had his little sister to think of
38,when he said that i knew he was afraid
142,jem had his little sister to think of the time i dared him to jump off the top of the house if i got killed whatd become of you
129,then he jumped landed unhurt and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the radley place
28,you gonna run out on a dare
75,if you are then dill you have to think about these things jem said
21,lemme think a minute
40,its sort of like making a turtle come out
25,strike a match under him
86,i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i was going to tell atticus on him
55,dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful
92,aint hateful just persuades him  s not like youd chunk him in the fire jem growled
40,how do you know a match dont hurt him
34,turtles cant feel stupid said jem
28,were you ever a turtle huh
13,my stars dill
15,now lemme think
22,reckon we can rock him
185,jem stood in thought so long that dill made a mild concession i wont say you ran out on a dare an ill swap you the gray ghost if you just go up and touch the house
14,jem brightened
26,touch the house that all
10,dill nodded
20,sure thats all now
67,i dont want you hollerin something different the minute i get back
25,yeah thats all said dill
177,hell probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aint gonna hurt him
116,we left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the radley house and stopped at the gate
54,well go on said dill scout and mes right behind you
33,im going said jem dont hurry me
170,he walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head
22,then i sneered at him
169,jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past us not waiting to see if his foray was successful
33,dill and i followed on his heels
64,safely on our porch panting and out of breath we looked back
124,the old house was the same droopy and sick but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move
59,a tiny almost invisible movement and the house was still
97,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  dill left us early in september to return to meridian
157,we saw him off on the five oclock bus and i was miserable without him until it occurred to me that i would be starting to school in a week
55,i never looked forward more to anything in my life
343,hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse looking over at the schoolyard spying on multitudes of children through a twopower telescope jem had given me learning their games following jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories
20,i longed to join them
187,jem condescended to take me to school the first day a job usually done by ones parents but atticus had said jem would be delighted to show me where my room was
167,i think some money changed hands in this transaction for as we trotted around the corner past the radley place i heard an unfamiliar jingle in jems pockets
373,when we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard jem was careful to explain that during school hours i was not to bother him i was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of tarzan and the ant men to embarrass him with references to his private life or tag along behind him at recess and noon
73,i was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth
36,in short i was to leave him alone
30,you mean we cant play any more
84,well do like we always do at home he said but youll see  schools different
17,it certainly was
209,before the first morning was over miss caroline fisher our teacher hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler then made me stand in the corner until noon
42,miss caroline was no more than twentyone
78,she had bright auburn hair pink cheeks and wore crimson fingernail polish
66,she also wore highheeled pumps and a red and whitestriped dress
46,she looked and smelled like a peppermint drop
192,she boarded across the street one door down from us in miss maudie atkinsons upstairs front room and when miss maudie introduced us to her jem was in a haze for days
112,miss caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said this says i am miss caroline fisher
45,i am from north alabama from winston county
132,the class murmured apprehensively should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region
136,when alabama seceded from the union on january   winston county seceded from alabama and every child in maycomb county knew it
136,north alabama was full of liquor interests big mules steel companies republicans professors and other persons of no background
64,miss caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats
142,the cats had long conversations with one another they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove
147,by the time mrs cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms
237,miss caroline seemed unaware that the ragged denimshirted and floursackskirted first grade most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk were immune to imaginative literature
80,miss caroline came to the end of the story and said oh my wasnt that nice
169,then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals turned to the class and asked does anybody know what these are
69,everybody did most of the first grade had failed it last year
359,i suppose she chose me because she knew my name as i read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows and after making me read most of my first reader and the stockmarket quotations from the mobile register aloud she discovered that i was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste
104,miss caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more it would interfere with my reading
18,i said in surprise
45,he hasnt taught me anything miss caroline
108,atticus aint got time to teach me anything i added when miss caroline smiled and shook her head
71,why hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads
30,if he didnt teach you who did
31,miss caroline asked goodnaturedly
12,somebody did
45,you werent born reading the mobile register
14,jem says i was
67,he read in a book where i was a bullfinch instead of a finch
167,jem says my names really jean louise bullfinch that i got swapped when i was born and im really a miss caroline apparently thought i was lying
63,lets not let our imaginations run away with us dear she said
55,now you tell your father not to teach you any more
45,its best to begin reading with a fresh mind
75,you tell him ill take over from here and try to undo the damage maam
40,your father does not know how to teach
24,you can have a seat now
68,i mumbled that i was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime
109,i never deliberately learned to read but somehow i had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers
54,in the long hours of church  was it then i learned
56,i could not remember not being able to read hymns
234,now that i was compelled to think about it reading was something that just came to me as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces
342,i could not remember when the lines above atticuss moving finger separated into words but i had stared at them all the evenings in my memory listening to the news of the day bills to be enacted into laws the diaries of lorenzo dow  anything atticus happened to be reading when i crawled into his lap every night
54,until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read
28,one does not love breathing
180,i knew i had annoyed miss caroline so i let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when jem cut me from the covey of firstgraders in the schoolyard
32,he asked how i was getting along
32,if i didnt have to stay id leave
130,jem that damn lady says atticuss been teaching me to read and for him to stop it dont worry scout jem comforted me
63,our teacher says miss carolines introducing a new way of teaching
33,she learned about it in college
32,itll be in all the grades soon
117,you dont have to learn much out of books that way  its like if you wanta learn about cows you go milk one see
57,yeah jem but i dont wanta study cows i sure you do
71,you hafta know about cows theyre a big part of life in maycomb county
62,i contented myself with asking jem if hed lost his mind
84,im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade stubborn
28,its the dewey decimal system
81,having never questioned jems pronouncements i saw no reason to begin now
139,the dewey decimal system consisted in part of miss caroline waving cards at us on which were printed the cat rat man and you
113,no comment seemed to be expected of us and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence
41,i was bored so i began a letter to dill
86,miss caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me
17,besides she said
44,we dont write in the first grade we print
56,you wont learn to write until youre in the third grade
36,calpurnia was to blame for this
61,it kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days i guess
153,she would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet then copying out a chapter of the bible beneath
143,if i reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily she rewarded me with an openfaced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar
119,in calpurnia s teaching there was no sentimentality i seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me
117,everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands said miss caroline breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia
51,the town children did so and she looked us over
62,everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk
85,molasses buckets appeared from nowhere and the ceiling danced with metallic light
165,miss caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers nodding if the contents pleased her frowning a little at others
45,she stopped at walter cunninghams desk
12,wheres yours
81,walter cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms
43,his absence of shoes told us how he got them
78,people caught hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows
144,if walter had owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid winter
64,he did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls
40,did you forget your lunch this morning
19,asked miss caroline
30,walter looked straight ahead
43,i saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw
31,did you forget it this morning
19,asked miss caroline
27,walters jaw twitched again
25,yebm he finally mumbled
56,miss caroline went to her desk and opened her purse
34,heres a quarter she said to walter
24,go and eat downtown today
30,you can pay me back tomorrow
23,walter shook his head
38,nome thank you maam he drawled softly
71,impatience crept into miss carolines voice here walter come get it
30,walter shook his head again
95,when walter shook his head a third time someone whispered go on and tell her scout
101,i turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me
153,miss caroline and i had conferred twice already and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding
60,i rose graciously on walters behalf ah  miss caroline
22,what is it jean louise
32,miss caroline hes a cunningham
15,i sat back down
16,what jean louise
52,i thought i had made things sufficiently clear
99,it was clear enough to the rest of us walter cunningham was sitting there lying his head off
51,he didnt forget his lunch he didnt have any
72,he had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day
91,he had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life
62,i tried again walters one of the cunninghams miss caroline
29,i beg your pardon jean louise
73,thats okay maam youll get to know all the county folks after a while
103,the cunninghams never took anything they cant pay back  no church baskets and no scrip stamps
77,they never took anything off of anybody they get along on what they have
41,they dont have much but they get along on it
117,my special knowledge of the cunningham tribe  one branch that is  was gained from events of last winter
46,walters father was one of atticuss clients
189,after a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment before mr cunningham left he said mr finch i dont know when ill ever be able to pay you
56,let that be the least of your worries walter atticus said
171,when i asked jem what entailment was and jem described it as a condition of having your tail in a crack i asked atticus if mr cunningham would ever pay us
82,not in money atticus said but before the years out ill have been paid
67,one morning jem and i found a load of stovewood in the back yard
59,later a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps
51,with christmas came a crate of smilax and holly
122,that spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens atticus said mr cunningham had more than paid him
30,why does he pay you like that
43,because thats the only way he can pay me
15,he has no money
20,are we poor atticus
15,atticus nodded
13,we are indeed
18,jems nose wrinkled
36,are we as poor as the cunninghams
11,not exactly
78,the cunninghams are country folks farmers and the crash hit them hardest
79,atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor
117,as maycomb county was farm country nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers
62,entailment was only a part of mr cunninghams vexations
102,the acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt and the little cash he made went to interest
194,if he held his mouth right mr cunningham could get a wpa job but his land would go to ruin if he left it and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased
59,mr cunningham said atticus came from a set breed of men
95,as the cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer they simply paid us with what they had
63,did you know said atticus that dr reynolds works the same way
68,he charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby
81,miss scout if you give me your attention ill tell you what entailment is
56,jems definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes
298,if i could have explained these things to miss caroline i would have saved myself some inconvenience and miss caroline subsequent mortification but it was beyond my ability to explain things as well as atticus so i said youre shamin him miss caroline
84,walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you and you cant use any stovewood
98,miss caroline stood stock still then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk
64,jean louise ive had about enough of you this morning she said
56,youre starting off on the wrong foot in every way my dear
19,hold out your hand
162,i thought she was going to spit in it which was the only reason anybody in maycomb held out his hand it was a timehonored method of sealing oral contracts
131,wondering what bargain we had made i turned to the class for an answer but the class looked back at me in puzzlement
117,miss caroline picked up her ruler gave me half a dozen quick little pats then told me to stand in the corner
117,a storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that miss caroline had whipped me
168,when miss caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again becoming cold sober only when the shadow of miss blount fell over them
228,miss blount a native maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the decimal system appeared at the door hands on hips and announced if i hear another sound from this room ill burn up everybody in it
92,miss caroline the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket
43,my sojourn in the corner was a short one
72,saved by the bell miss caroline watched the class file out for lunch
101,as i was the last to leave i saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arms
82,had her conduct been more friendly toward me i would have felt sorry for her
30,she was a pretty little thing
200,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  catching walter cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure but when i was rubbing his nose in the dirt jem came by and told me to stop
30,youre biggern he is he said
32,hes as old as you nearly i said
43,he made me start off on the wrong foot
16,let him go scout
94,he didnt have any lunch i said and explained my involvement in walters dietary affairs
81,walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to jem and me
77,his fists were half cocked as if expecting an onslaught from both of us
80,i stomped at him to chase him away but jem put out his hand and stopped me
46,he examined walter with an air of speculation
47,your daddy mr walter cunningham from old sarum
28,he asked and walter nodded
124,walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food his eyes as blue as dill harriss were redrimmed and watery
92,there was no color in his face except at the tip of his nose which was moistly pink
81,he fingered the straps of his overalls nervously picking at the metal hooks
27,jem suddenly grinned at him
48,come on home to dinner with us walter he said
25,wed be glad to have you
42,walters face brightened then darkened
44,jem said our daddys a friend of your daddys
55,scout here shes crazy  she wont fight you any more
43,i wouldnt be too certain of that i said
98,jems free dispensation of my pledge irked me but precious noontime minutes were ticking away
40,yeah walter i wont jump on you again
26,dont you like butterbeans
26,our cals a real good cook
41,walter stood where he was biting his lip
96,jem and i gave up and we were nearly to the radley place when walter called hey im comin
73,when walter caught up with us jem made pleasant conversation with him
71,a haint lives there he said cordially pointing to the radley house
29,ever hear about him walter
27,reckon i have said walter
150,almost died first year i come to school and et them pecans  folks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence
88,jem seemed to have little fear of boo radley now that walter and i walked beside him
90,indeed jem grew boastful i went all the way up to the house once he said to walter
125,anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passes it i said to the clouds above
28,and whos runnin miss priss
35,you are when aint anybody with you
83,by the time we reached our front steps walter had forgotten he was a cunningham
85,jem ran to the kitchen and asked calpurnia to set an extra plate we had company
100,atticus greeted walter and began a discussion about crops neither jem nor i could follow
180,reason i cant pass the first grade mr finch is ive had to stay out ever spring an help papa with the choppin but theres anothern at the house now thats field size
42,did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him
42,i asked but atticus shook his head at me
117,while walter piled food on his plate he and atticus talked together like two men to the wonderment of jem and me
123,atticus was expounding upon farm problems when walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house
71,atticus summoned calpurnia who returned bearing the syrup pitcher
47,she stood waiting for walter to help himself
76,walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand
110,he would probably have poured it into his milk glass had i not asked what the sam hill he was doing
108,the silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher and he quickly put his hands in his lap
25,then he ducked his head
38,atticus shook his head at me again
59,but hes gone and drowned his dinner in syrup i protested
90,hes poured it all over it was then that calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen
78,she was furious and when she was furious calpurnia s grammar became erratic
69,when in tranquility her grammar was as good as anybodys in maycomb
74,atticus said calpurnia had more education than most colored folks
74,when she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened
166,theres some folks who dont eat like us she whispered fiercely but you aint called on to contradict em at the table when they dont
89,that boys yo compny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him you hear
63,he aint company cal hes just a cunningham hush your mouth
177,dont matter who they are anybody sets foot in this houses yo compny and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you was so high and mighty
211,yo folks might be bettern the cunninghams but it dont count for nothin the way youre disgracin em  if you cant act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen
89,calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack
143,i retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen thankful though that i was spared the humiliation of facing them again
163,i told calpurnia to just wait id fix her one of these days when she wasnt looking id go off and drown myself in barkers eddy and then shed be sorry
123,besides i added shed already gotten me in trouble once today she had taught me to write and it was all her fault
26,hush your fussin she said
184,jem and walter returned to school ahead of me staying behind to advise atticus of calpurnias iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the radley place
127,she likes jem bettern she likes me anyway i concluded and suggested that atticus lose no time in packing her off
69,have you ever considered that jem doesnt worry her half as much
27,atticuss voice was flinty
51,ive no intention of getting rid of her now or ever
83,we couldnt operate a single day without cal have you ever thought of that
72,you think about how much cal does for you and you mind her you hear
107,i returned to school and hated calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentments
107,i looked up to see miss caroline standing in the middle of the room sheer horror flooding her face
69,apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession
12,she screamed
73,the male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance
40,lord i thought shes scared of a mouse
125,little chuck little whose patience with all living things was phenomenal said which way did he go miss caroline
26,tell us where he went quick
73,dc he turned to a boy behind him  dc shut the door and well catch him
23,quick maam whered he go
120,miss caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk but to a hulking individual unknown to me
79,little chucks face contracted and he said gently you mean him maam
16,yessum hes alive
27,did he scare you some way
93,miss caroline said desperately i was just walking by when it crawled out of his hair
62,just crawled out of his hair little chuck grinned broadly
41,there aint no need to fear a cootie maam
24,aint you ever seen one
85,now dont you be afraid you just go back to your desk and teach us some more
147,little chuck little was another member of the population who didnt know where his next meal was coming from but he was a born gentleman
84,he put his hand under her elbow and led miss caroline to the front of the room
32,now dont you fret maam he said
37,there aint no need to fear a cootie
37,ill just fetch you some cool water
84,the cooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought
107,he searched the scalp above his forehead located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger
61,miss caroline watched the process in horrid fascination
78,little chuck brought water in a paper cup and she drank it gratefully
30,finally she found her voice
21,what is your name son
16,she asked softly
14,the boy blinked
20,miss caroline nodded
12,burris ewell
39,miss caroline inspected her rollbook
53,i have a ewell here but i dont have a first name
41,would you spell your first name for me
13,dont know how
25,they call me burrist home
98,well burris said miss caroline i think wed better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon
41,i want you to go home and wash your hair
99,from her desk she produced a thick volume leafed through its pages and read for a moment
88,a good home remedy for  burris i want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap
56,when youve done that treat your scalp with kerosene
15,what fer missus
27,to get rid of the  er cooties
98,you see burris the other children might catch them and you wouldnt want that would you
16,the boy stood up
45,he was the filthiest human i had ever seen
109,his neck was dark gray the backs of his hands were rusty and his fingernails were black deep into the quick
73,he peered at miss caroline from a fistsized clean space on his face
115,no one had noticed him probably because miss caroline and i had entertained the class most of the morning
90,and burris said miss caroline please bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow
25,the boy laughed rudely
31,you aint sendin me home missus
65,i was on the verge of leavin  i done done my time for this year
31,miss caroline looked puzzled
24,what do you mean by that
23,the boy did not answer
35,he gave a short contemptuous snort
173,one of the elderly members of the class answered her hes one of the ewells maam and i wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt
44,but miss caroline seemed willing to listen
25,whole schools full of em
48,they come first day every year and then leave
113,the truant lady gets em here cause she threatens em with the sheriff but shes give up tryin to hold em
129,she reckons shes carried out the law just gettin their names on the roll and runnin em here the first day
57,youre supposed to mark em absent the rest of the year
28,but what about their parents
39,asked miss caroline in genuine concern
69,aint got no mother was the answer and their paws right contentious
47,burris ewell was flattered by the recital
92,been comin to the first day o the first grade fer three year now he said expansively
65,reckon if im smart this year theyll promote me to the second
118,miss caroline said sit back down please burris and the moment she said it i knew she had made a serious mistake
40,the boys condescension flashed to anger
29,you try and make me missus
40,little chuck little got to his feet
25,let him go maam he said
37,hes a mean one a harddown mean one
65,hes liable to start somethin and theres some little folks here
138,he was among the most diminutive of men but when burris ewell turned toward him little chucks right hand went to his pocket
32,watch your step burris he said
35,id soons kill you as look at you
11,now go home
126,burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height and miss caroline took advantage of his indecision burris go home
47,if you dont ill call the principal she said
33,ill have to report this anyway
53,the boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door
72,safely out of range he turned and shouted report and be damned to ye
76,aint no snotnosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born cn make me do nothin
40,you aint makin me go nowhere missus
53,you just remember that you aint makin me go nowhere
87,he waited until he was sure she was crying then he shuffled out of the building
83,soon we were clustered around her desk trying in our various ways to comfort her
21,he was a real mean one
15,below the belt
46,you aint called on to teach folks like that
51,them aint maycombs ways miss caroline not really
22,now dont you fret maam
44,miss caroline why dont you read us a story
40,that cat thing was real fine this mornin
192,miss caroline smiled blew her nose said thank you darlings dispersed us opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall
135,when i passed the radley place for the fourth time that day  twice at a full gallop  my gloom had deepened to match the house
253,if the remainder of the school year were as fraught with drama as the first day perhaps it would be mildly entertaining but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think of running away
207,by late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete when jem and i raced each other up the sidewalk to meet atticus coming home from work i didnt give him much of a race
113,it was our habit to run meet atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance
110,atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace he was full of questions about school
54,my replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me
96,perhaps calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one she let me watch her fix supper
76,shut your eyes and open your mouth and ill give you a surprise she said
148,it was not often that she made crackling bread she said she never had time but with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her
36,she knew i loved crackling bread
24,i missed you today she said
80,the house got so lonesome long about two oclock i had to turn on the radio
54,jemn me aint ever in the house unless its rainin
62,i know she said but one of yous always in callin distance
64,i wonder how much of the day i spend just callin after you
119,well she said getting up from the kitchen chair its enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread i reckon
51,you run along now and let me get supper on the table
35,calpurnia bent down and kissed me
47,i ran along wondering what had come over her
49,she had wanted to make up with me that was it
138,she had always been too hard on me she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways she was sorry and too stubborn to say so
32,i was weary from the days crimes
85,after supper atticus sat down with the paper and called scout ready to read
74,the lord sent me more than i could bear and i went to the front porch
21,atticus followed me
20,something wrong scout
122,i told atticus i didnt feel very well and didnt think id go to school any more if it was all right with him
59,atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs
108,his fingers wandered to his watchpocket he said that was the only way he could think
164,he waited in amiable silence and i sought to reinforce my position you never went to school and you do all right so ill just stay home too
57,you can teach me like granddaddy taught you n uncle jack
21,no i cant said atticus
25,i have to make a living
113,besides theyd put me in jail if i kept you at home  dose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow
27,im feeling all right really
21,now whats the matter
124,bit by bit i told him the days misfortunes and she said you taught me all wrong so we cant ever read any more ever
36,please dont send me back please sir
56,atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch
88,when he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me
118,first of all he said if you can learn a simple trick scout youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks
100,you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view sir
54,until you climb into his skin and walk around in it
105,atticus said i had learned many things today and miss caroline had learned several things herself
191,she had learned not to hand something to a cunningham for one thing but if walter and i had put ourselves in her shoes wed have seen it was an honest mistake on her part
140,we could not expect her to learn all maycombs ways in one day and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better
20,ill be dogged i said
125,i didnt know no better than not to read to her and she held me responsible  listen atticus i dont have to go to school
38,i was bursting with a sudden thought
22,burris ewell remember
40,he just goes to school the first day
130,the truant lady reckons shes carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll you cant do that scout atticus said
69,sometimes its better to bend the law a little in special cases
38,in your case the law remains rigid
22,so to school you must go
41,i dont see why i have to when he doesnt
11,then listen
84,atticus said the ewells had been the disgrace of maycomb for three generations
66,none of them had done an honest days work in his recollection
133,he said that some christmas when he was getting rid of the tree he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived
47,they were people but they lived like animals
135,they can go to school any time they want to when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education said atticus
195,there are ways of keeping them in school by force but its silly to force people like the ewells into a new environment if i didnt go to school tomorrow youd force me to
46,let us leave it at this said atticus dryly
48,you miss scout finch are of the common folk
20,you must obey the law
84,he said that the ewells were members of an exclusive society made up of ewells
175,in certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the ewells activities
47,they didnt have to go to school for one thing
90,another thing mr bob ewell burriss father was permitted to hunt and trap out of season
24,atticus thats bad i said
123,in maycomb county hunting out of season was a misdemeanor at law a capital felony in the eyes of the populace
197,its against the law all right said my father and its certainly bad but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains
108,i dont know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit
82,mr ewell shouldnt do that of course he shouldnt but hell never change his ways
61,are you going to take out your disapproval on his children
110,no sir i murmured and made a final stand but if i keep on goin to school we cant ever read any more
35,thats really bothering you isnt it
108,when atticus looked down at me i saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something
32,do you know what a compromise is
14,bending the law
49,no an agreement reached by mutual concessions
25,it works this way he said
114,if youll concede the necessity of going to school well go on reading every night just as we always have
15,is it a bargain
110,well consider it sealed without the usual formality atticus said when he saw me preparing to spit
143,as i opened the front screen door atticus said by the way scout youd better not say anything at school about our agreement
116,im afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authorities
191,jem and i were accustomed to our fathers lastwillandtestament diction and we were at all times free to interrupt atticus for a translation when it was beyond our understanding
168,i never went to school he said but i have a feeling that if you tell miss caroline we read every night shell get after me and i wouldnt want her after me
239,atticus kept us in fits that evening gravely reading columns of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason which was reason enough for jem to spend the following saturday aloft in the treehouse
126,jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not atticus severed his supply lines
274,i had spent most of the day climbing up and down running errands for him providing him with literature nourishment and water and was carrying him blankets for the night when atticus said if i paid no attention to him jem would come down
18,atticus was right
111,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  the remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first
257,indeed they were an endless project that slowly evolved into a unit in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the state of alabama in its wellmeaning but fruitless efforts to teach me group dynamics
159,what jem called the dewey decimal system was schoolwide by the end of my first year so i had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques
155,i could only look around me atticus and my uncle who went to school at home knew everything  at least what one didnt know the other did
261,furthermore i couldnt help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature elected each time without opposition innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of good citizenship
222,jem educated on a halfdecimal half duncecap basis seemed to function effectively alone or in a group but jem was a poor example no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books
324,as for me i knew nothing except what i gathered from time magazine and reading everything i could lay hands on at home but as i inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the maycomb county school system i could not help receiving the impression that i was being cheated out of something
145,out of what i knew not yet i did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me
242,as the year passed released from school thirty minutes before jem who had to stay until three oclock i ran by the radley place as fast as i could not stopping until i reached the safety of our front porch
155,one afternoon as i raced by something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that i took a deep breath a long look around and went back
125,two live oaks stood at the edge of the radley lot their roots reached out into the sideroad and made it bumpy
59,something about one of the trees attracted my attention
107,some tinfoil was sticking in a knothole just above my eye level winking at me in the afternoon sun
156,i stood on tiptoe hastily looked around once more reached into the hole and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers
106,my first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible but i remembered where i was
57,i ran home and on our front porch i examined my loot
21,the gum looked fresh
43,i sniffed it and it smelled all right
36,i licked it and waited for a while
68,when i did not die i crammed it into my mouth wrigleys double mint
61,when jem came home he asked me where i got such a wad
22,i told him i found it
32,dont eat things you find scout
43,this wasnt on the ground it was in a tree
11,jem growled
19,well it was i said
65,it was sticking in that tree yonder the one comin from school
22,spit it out right now
13,i spat it out
27,the tang was fading anyway
75,ive been chewin it all afternoon and i aint dead yet not even sick
22,jem stamped his foot
71,dont you know youre not supposed to even touch the trees over there
26,youll get killed if you do
25,you touched the house once
18,that was different
38,you go gargle  right now you hear me
46,aint neither itll take the taste outa my mouth
39,you dont n ill tell calpurnia on you
64,rather than risk a tangle with calpurnia i did as jem told me
229,for some reason my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship calpurnias tyranny unfairness and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval
68,on my part i went to much trouble sometimes not to provoke her
64,summer was on the way jem and i awaited it with impatience
251,summer was our best season it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots or trying to sleep in the treehouse summer was everything good to eat it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape but most of all summer was dill
98,the authorities released us early the last day of school and jem and i walked home together
52,reckon old dillll be coming home tomorrow i said
28,probably day after said jem
37,missippi turns em loose a day later
272,as we came to the live oaks at the radley place i raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knothole where i had found the chewing gum trying to make jem believe i had found it there and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil
14,i see it scout
82,i see it jem looked around reached up and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package
138,we ran home and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewinggum wrappers
84,it was the kind of box wedding rings came in purple velvet with a minute catch
35,jem flicked open the tiny catch
73,inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies one on top of the other
17,jem examined them
20,indianheads he said
52,nineteensix and scout one of ems nineteenhundred
17,these are real old
25,nineteenhundred i echoed
31,say hush a minute im thinkin
48,jem you reckon thats somebodys hidin place
118,naw dont anybody much but us pass by there unless its some grown persons grown folks dont have hidin places
34,you reckon we ought to keep em jem
36,i dont know what we could do scout
25,whod we give em back to
124,i know for a fact dont anybody go by there  cecil goes by the back street an all the way around by town to get home
203,cecil jacobs who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the radley place and old mrs henry lafayette dubose
153,mrs dubose lived two doors up the street from us neighborhood opinion was unanimous that mrs dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived
59,jem wouldnt go by her place without atticus beside him
34,what you reckon we oughta do jem
48,finders were keepers unless title was proven
229,plucking an occasional camellia getting a squirt of hot milk from miss maudie atkinsons cow on a summer day helping ourselves to someones scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture but money was different
22,tell you what said jem
87,well keep em till school starts then go around and ask everybody if theyre theirs
112,theyre some bus childs maybe  he was too taken up with gettin outa school today an forgot em
32,these are somebodys i know that
32,see how theyve been slicked up
17,theyve been saved
68,yeah but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that
24,you know it doesnt last
16,i dont know scout
36,but these are important to somebody
13,hows that jem
56,well indianheads  well they come from the indians
60,theyre real strong magic they make you have good luck
133,not like fried chicken when youre not lookin for it but things like long life n good health n passin sixweeks tests
36,these are real valuable to somebody
29,im gonna put em in my trunk
77,before jem went to his room he looked for a long time at the radley place
31,he seemed to be thinking again
446,two days later dill arrived in a blaze of glory he had ridden the train by himself from meridian to maycomb junction a courtesy title  maycomb junction was in abbott county where he had been met by miss rachel in maycomb s one taxi he had eaten dinner in the diner he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in bay st louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats
202,he had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt he was somewhat heavier no taller and said he had seen his father
114,dills father was taller than ours he had a black beard pointed and was president of the l amp n railroad
55,i helped the engineer for a while said dill yawning
31,in a pigs ear you did dill
14,hush said jem
21,whatll we play today
34,tom and sam and dick said dill
26,lets go in the front yard
78,dill wanted the rover boys because there were three respectable parts
54,he was clearly tired of being our character man
25,im tired of those i said
173,i was tired of playing tom rover who suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the end when he was found in alaska
26,make us up one jem i said
26,im tired of makin em up
46,our first days of freedom and we were tired
41,i wondered what the summer would bring
121,we had strolled to the front yard where dill stood looking down the street at the dreary face of the radley place
25,i  smell  death he said
54,i do i mean it he said when i told him to shut up
50,you mean when somebodys dyin you can smell it
62,no i mean i can smell somebody an tell if theyre gonna die
25,an old lady taught me how
32,dill leaned over and sniffed me
55,jean  louise  finch you are going to die in three days
51,dill if you dont hush ill knock you bowlegged
81,i mean it now yawl hush growled jem you act like you believe in hot steams
30,you act like you dont i said
17,whats a hot steam
85,havent you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place
14,jem asked dill
257,a hot steams somebody who cant get to heaven just wallows around on lonesome roads an if you walk through him when you die youll be one too an youll go around at night suckin peoples breath how can you keep from passing through one
17,you cant said jem
164,sometimes they stretch all the way across the road but if you hafta go through one you say angelbright lifeindeath get off the road dont suck my breath
98,that keeps em from wrapping around you dont you believe a word he says dill i said
32,calpurnia says thats nigger talk
80,jem scowled darkly at me but said well are we gonna play anything or not
35,lets roll in the tire i suggested
20,you know im too big
11,you cn push
81,i ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house
35,i slapped it up to the front yard
15,im first i said
51,dill said he ought to be first he just got here
105,jem arbitrated awarded me first push with an extra time for dill and i folded myself inside the tire
174,until it happened i did not realize that jem was offended by my contradicting him on hot steams and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me
79,he did by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body
86,ground sky and houses melted into a mad palette my ears throbbed i was suffocating
87,i could not put out my hands to stop they were wedged between my chest and knees
117,i could only hope that jem would outrun the tire and me or that i would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk
45,i heard him behind me chasing and shouting
135,the tire bumped on gravel skeetered across the road crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement
150,dizzy and nauseated i lay on the cement and shook my head still pounded my ears to silence and heard jems voice scout get away from there come on
77,i raised my head and stared at the radley place steps in front of me
39,come on scout dont just lie there
17,jem was screaming
13,get up cantcha
40,i got to my feet trembling as i thawed
13,get the tire
13,jem hollered
18,bring it with you
33,aint you got any sense at all
91,when i was able to navigate i ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me
23,why didnt you bring it
21,why dont you get it
13,jem was silent
37,go on it aint far inside the gate
47,why you even touched the house once remember
141,jem looked at me furiously could not decline ran down the sidewalk treaded water at the gate then dashed in and retrieved the tire
31,jem was scowling triumphantly
12,nothin to it
70,i swear scout sometimes you act so much like a girl its mortifyin
71,there was more to it than he knew but i decided not to tell him
67,calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled lemonade time
55,you all get in outa that hot sun fore you fry alive
64,lemonade in the middle of the morning was a summertime ritual
97,calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch then went about her business
59,being out of jems good graces did not worry me especially
40,lemonade would restore his good humor
64,jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest
50,i know what we are going to play he announced
34,something new something different
210,jems head at times was transparent he had thought that up to make me understand he wasnt afraid of radleys in any shape or form to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice
58,jem said scout you can be mrs radley i declare if i will
21,i dont think  smarter
12,still scared
48,he can get out at night when were all asleep
43,scout hows he gonna know what were doin
38,besides i dont think hes still there
60,he died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney
75,dill said jem you and me can play and scout can watch if shes scared
250,i was fairly sure boo radley was inside that house but i couldnt prove it and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or i would be accused of believing in hot steams phenomena i was immune to in the daytime
108,jem parceled out our roles i was mrs radley and all i had to do was come out and sweep the porch
101,dill was old mr radley he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when jem spoke to him
102,jem naturally was boo he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time
44,as the summer progressed so did our game
159,we polished and perfected it added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changes every day
146,dill was a villains villain he could get into any character part assigned him and appear tall if height was part of the devilry required
73,he was as good as his worst performance his worst performance was gothic
67,i reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script
274,i never thought it as much fun as tarzan and i played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite jems assurances that boo radley was dead and nothing would get me with him and calpurnia there in the daytime and atticus home at night
20,jem was a born hero
205,it was a melancholy little drama woven from bits and scraps of gossip and neighborhood legend mrs radley had been beautiful until she married mr radley and lost all her money
87,she also lost most of her teeth her hair and her right forefinger dills contribution
87,boo bit it off one night when he couldnt find any cats and squirrels to eat
131, she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time while boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house
190,the three of us were the boys who got into trouble i was the probate judge for a change dill led jem away and crammed him beneath the steps poking him with the brushbroom
192,jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff assorted townsfolk and miss stephanie crawford who had more to say about the radleys than anybody in maycomb
217,when it was time to play boos big scene jem would sneak into the house steal the scissors from the sewingmachine drawer when calpurnia s back was turned then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers
81,dill would walk by cough at jem and jem would fake a plunge into dills thigh
37,from where i stood it looked real
182,when mr nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town we would stand still and silent until he was out of sight then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected
187,our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared and once i saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at us her hedge clippers poised in midair
203,one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv book ii of one mans family we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us slapping a rolled magazine against his knee
26,the sun said twelve noon
25,what are you all playing
15,nothing said jem
60,jems evasion told me our game was a secret so i kept quiet
45,what are you doing with those scissors then
37,why are you tearing up that newspaper
27,if its todays ill tan you
12,nothing what
11,said atticus
10,nothing sir
41,give me those scissors atticus said
32,theyre no things to play with
67,does this by any chance have anything to do with the radleys
26,no sir said jem reddening
61,i hope it doesnt he said shortly and went inside the house
12,jem shut up
60,hes gone in the livingroom he can hear us in there
67,safely in the yard dill asked jem if we could play any more
11,i dont know
76,atticus didnt say we couldnt jem i said i think atticus knows it anyway
27,if he did hed say he did
242,i was not so sure but jem told me i was being a girl that girls always imagined things thats why other people hated them so and if i started behaving like one i could just go off and find some to play with
41,all right you just keep it up then i said
16,youll find out
70,atticus s arrival was the second reason i wanted to quit the game
77,the first reason happened the day i rolled into the radley front yard
154,through all the head shaking quelling of nausea and jemyelling i had heard another sound so low i could not have heard it from the sidewalk
41,someone inside the house was laughing
180,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  my nagging got the better of jem eventually as i knew it would and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while
291,he still maintained however that atticus hadnt said we couldnt therefore we could and if atticus ever said we couldnt jem had thought of a way around it he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldnt be accused of playing anything
60,dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action
75,dill was becoming something of a trial anyway following jem about
90,he had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him then he promptly forgot about it
118,he staked me out marked as his property said i was the only girl he would ever love then he neglected me
72,i beat him up twice but it did no good he only grew closer to jem
118,they spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning calling me only when they needed a third party
224,but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while and on pain of being called a girl i spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch
156,jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudies yard if we kept out of her azaleas but our contact with her was not clearly defined
139,until jem and dill excluded me from their plans she was only another lady in the neighborhood but a relatively benign presence
374,our tacit treaty with miss maudie was that we could play on her lawn eat her scuppernongs if we didnt jump on the arbor and explore her vast back lot terms so generous we seldom spoke to her so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship but jem and dill drove me closer to her with their behavior
62,miss maudie hated her house time spent indoors was time wasted
243,she was a widow a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and mens coveralls but after her five oclock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty
59,she loved everything that grew in gods earth even the weeds
18,with one exception
315,if she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the second battle of the marne she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful itd kill us all if we didnt stand out of the way
28,why cant you just pull it up
91,i asked after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high
28,pull it up child pull it up
80,she picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk
27,microscopic grains oozed out
55,why one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard
88,when it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over maycomb county
84,miss maudies face likened such an occurrence unto an old testament pestilence
53,her speech was crisp for a maycomb county inhabitant
121,she called us by all our names and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth
89,when i admired them and hoped i would have some eventually she said look here
122,with a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship
189,miss maudies benevolence extended to jem and dill whenever they paused in their pursuits we reaped the benefits of a talent miss maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us
46,she made the best cakes in the neighborhood
219,when she was admitted into our confidence every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones and she would call across the street jem finch scout finch charles baker harris come here
38,our promptness was always rewarded
49,in summertime twilights are long and peaceful
262,often as not miss maudie and i would sit silently on her porch watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops
74,miss maudie i said one evening do you think boo radleys still alive
41,his names arthur and hes alive she said
47,she was rocking slowly in her big oak chair
23,do you smell my mimosa
36,its like angels breath this evening
15,how do you know
16,know what child
28,that b mr arthurs still alive
24,what a morbid question
35,but i suppose its a morbid subject
74,i know hes alive jean louise because i havent seen him carried out yet
52,maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney
33,where did you get such a notion
41,thats what jem said he thought they did
41,he gets more like jack finch every day
83,miss maudie had known uncle jack finch atticuss brother since they were children
70,nearly the same age they had grown up together at finchs landing
81,miss maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner dr frank buford
122,dr bufords profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground so he stayed poor
107,uncle jack finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in nashville and stayed rich
128,we saw uncle jack every christmas and every christmas he yelled across the street for miss maudie to come marry him
135,miss maudie would yell back call a little louder jack finch and theyll hear you at the post office i havent heard you yet
126,jem and i thought this a strange way to ask for a ladys hand in marriage but then uncle jack was rather strange
348,he said he was trying to get miss maudies goat that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years that he was the last person in the world miss maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing and the best defense to her was spirited offense all of which we understood clearly
66,arthur radley just stays in the house thats all said miss maudie
67,wouldnt you stay in the house if you didnt want to come out
31,yessum but id wanta come out
13,why doesnt he
25,miss maudies eyes narrowed
35,you know that story as well as i do
26,i never heard why though
23,nobody ever told me why
35,miss maudie settled her bridgework
81,you know old mr radley was a foot washing baptist thats what you are aint it
31,my shells not that hard child
17,im just a baptist
37,dont you all believe in footwashing
22,at home in the bathtub
229,but we cant have communion with you all apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion miss maudie said footwashers believe anything thats pleasure is a sin
147,did you know some of em came out of the woods one saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell
16,your flowers too
25,theyd burn right with me
114,they thought i spent too much time in gods outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the bible
123,my confidence in pulpit gospel lessened at the vision of miss maudie stewing forever in various protestant hells
143,true enough she had an acid tongue in her head and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good as did miss stephanie crawford
118,but while no one with a grain of sense trusted miss stephanie jem and i had considerable faith in miss maudie
125,she had never told on us had never played catandmouse with us she was not at all interested in our private lives
18,she was our friend
103,how so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible
27,that aint right miss maudie
30,youre the best lady i know
19,miss maudie grinned
14,thank you maam
63,thing is footwashers think women are a sin by definition
42,they take the bible literally you know
73,is that why mr arthur stays in the house to keep away from women
10,ive no idea
26,it doesnt make sense to me
99,looks like if mr arthur was hankerin after heaven hed come out on the porch at least
125,atticus says gods loving folks like you love yourself miss maudie stopped rocking and her voice hardened
167,you are too young to understand it she said but sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of  oh of your father
14,i was shocked
39,atticus doesnt drink whiskey i said
52,he never drunk a drop in his life  nome yes he did
51,he said he drank some one time and didnt like it
19,miss maudie laughed
43,wasnt talking about your father she said
126,what i meant was if atticus finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnt be as hard as some men are at their best
194,there are just some kind of men who  who re so busy worrying about the next world theyve never learned to live in this one and you can look down the street and see the results
69,do you think theyre true all those things they say about b  mr
10,what things
103,that is threefourths colored folks and onefourth stephanie crawford said miss maudie grimly
129,stephanie crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her
83,i said what did you do stephanie move over in the bed and make room for him
26,that shut her up a while
18,i was sure it did
53,miss maudie s voice was enough to shut anybody up
37,no child she said that is a sad house
44,i remember arthur radley when he was a boy
66,he always spoke nicely to me no matter what folks said he did
29,spoke as nicely as he knew how
21,you reckon hes crazy
26,miss maudie shook her head
32,if hes not he should be by now
60,the things that happen to people we never really know
203,what happens in houses behind closed doors what secrets atticus dont ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he dont do in the yard i said feeling it my duty to defend my parent
197,gracious child i was raveling a thread wasnt even thinking about your father but now that i am ill say this atticus finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets
50,howd you like some fresh poundcake to take home
21,i liked it very much
93,next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in conversation
49,when i joined them as usual they said go away
48,this yards as much mine as it is yours jem finch
54,i got just as much right to play in it as you have
112,dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle if you stay youve got to do what we tell you dill warned
49,we i said whos so high and mighty all of a sudden
94,if you dont say youll do what we tell you we aint gonna tell you anything dill continued
48,you act like you grew ten inches in the night
21,all right what is it
59,jem said placidly we are going to give a note to boo radley
61,i was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me
80,it was all right for miss maudie to talk  she was old and snug on her porch
24,it was different for us
110,jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters
47,if anyone came along dill would ring the bell
28,dill raised his right hand
43,in it was my mothers silver dinnerbell
51,im goin around to the side of the house said jem
73,we looked yesterday from across the street and theres a shutter loose
62,think maybe i can make it stick on the window sill at least
88,jem now youre in it and you cant get out of it youll just stay in it miss priss
36,okay okay but i dont wanta watch
189,jem somebody was yes you will youll watch the back end of the lot and dills gonna watch the front of the house an up the street an if anybody comes hell ring the bell
15,all right then
18,whatd you write him
178,dill said were askin him real politely to come out sometimes and tell us what he does in there  we said we wouldnt hurt him and wed buy him an ice cream
37,you allve gone crazy hell kill us
21,dill said its my idea
74,i figure if hed come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better
34,how do you know he dont feel good
88,well howd you feel if youd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin but cats to eat
53,i bet hes got a beard down to here like your daddys
65,he aint got a beard he dill stopped as if trying to remember
25,uh huh caughtcha i said
146,you said fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard if its all the same to you he shaved it off last summer
72,yeah an ive got the letter to prove it  he sent me two dollars too
62,keep on  i reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform
29,thatn never showed up did it
93,you just keep on tellin em son dill harris could tell the biggest ones i ever heard
225,among other things he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times he had been to nova scotia he had seen an elephant and his granddaddy was brigadier general joe wheeler and left him his sword
22,you all hush said jem
74,he scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole
57,reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk
105,anybody whos brave enough to go up and touch the house hadnt oughta use a fishin pole i said
42,why dont you just knock the front door down
79,this  is  different said jem how many times do i have to tell you that
67,dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to jem
59,the three of us walked cautiously toward the old house
142,dill remained at the lightpole on the front corner of the lot and jem and i edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house
76,i walked beyond jem and stood where i could see around the curve
14,all clear i said
19,not a soul in sight
46,jem looked up the sidewalk to dill who nodded
147,jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected
94,the pole lacked several inches of being long enough and jem leaned over as far as he could
93,i watched him making jabbing motions for so long i abandoned my post and went to him
81,cant get it off the pole he muttered or if i got it off i cant make it stay
32,gon back down the street scout
56,i returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road
99,occasionally i looked back at jem who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill
153,it would flutter to the ground and jem would jab it up until i thought if boo radley ever received it he wouldnt be able to read it
58,i was looking down the street when the dinnerbell rang
157,shoulder up i reeled around to face boo radley and his bloody fangs instead i saw dill ringing the bell with all his might in atticuss face
74,jem looked so awful i didnt have the heart to tell him i told him so
69,he trudged along dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk
37,atticus said stop ringing that bell
96,dill grabbed the clapper in the silence that followed i wished hed start ringing it again
87,atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips
34,jem he said what were you doing
24,i dont want any of that
53,i was  we were just tryin to give somethin to mr
35,what were you trying to give him
13,just a letter
13,let me see it
38,jem held out a filthy piece of paper
40,atticus took it and tried to read it
43,why do you want mr radley to come out
40,dill said we thought he might enjoy us
43,and dried up when atticus looked at him
100,son he said to jem im going to tell you something and tell you one time stop tormenting that man
37,that goes for the other two of you
39,what mr radley did was his own business
36,if he wanted to come out he would
186,if he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children which was a mild term for the likes of us
108,how would we like it if atticus barged in on us without knocking when we were in our rooms at night
55,we were in effect doing the same thing to mr radley
85,what mr radley did might seem peculiar to us but it did not seem peculiar to him
153,furthermore had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window
327,lastly we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town we werent makin fun of him we werent laughin at him said jem we were just so that was what you were doing wasnt it
17,makin fun of him
101,no said atticus putting his lifes history on display for the edification of the neighborhood
30,jem seemed to swell a little
49,i didnt say we were doin that i didnt say it
22,atticus grinned dryly
25,you just told me he said
54,you stop this nonsense right now every one of you
17,jem gaped at him
31,you want to be a lawyer dont you
84,our fathers mouth was suspiciously firm as if he were trying to hold it in line
67,jem decided there was no point in quibbling and was silent
199,when atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyers trick on record
115,he waited a respectful distance from the front steps watched atticus leave the house and walk toward town
119,when atticus was out of earshot jem yelled after him i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i aint so sure now
185,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  yes said our father when jem asked him if we could go over and sit by miss rachels fishpool with dill as this was his last night in maycomb
55,tell him so long for me and well see him next summer
87,we leaped over the low wall that separated miss rachels yard from our driveway
64,jem whistled bobwhite and dill answered in the darkness
29,not a breath blowing said jem
11,looka yonder
21,he pointed to the east
63,a gigantic moon was rising behind miss maudies pecan trees
37,that makes it seem hotter he said
19,cross in it tonight
27,asked dill not looking up
62,he was constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string
16,no just the lady
70,dont light that thing dill youll stink up this whole end of town
42,there was a lady in the moon in maycomb
36,she sat at a dresser combing her hair
31,were gonna miss you boy i said
31,reckon we better watch for mr
79,mr avery boarded across the street from mrs henry lafayette duboses house
139,besides making change in the collection plate every sunday mr avery sat on the porch every night until nine oclock and sneezed
180,one evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last for he never did it again so long as we watched
105,jem and i were leaving miss rachels front steps one night when dill stopped us golly looka yonder
30,he pointed across the street
261,at first we saw nothing but a kudzucovered front porch but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light some ten feet from source to earth it seemed to us
249,jem said mr avery misfigured dill said he must drink a gallon a day and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again as i was untalented in this area
59,dill stretched yawned and said altogether too casually
33,i know what lets go for a walk
23,he sounded fishy to me
43,nobody in maycomb just went for a walk
14,where to dill
45,dill jerked his head in a southerly direction
12,jem said okay
80,when i protested he said sweetly you dont have to come along angel may
20,you dont have to go
172,remember jem was not one to dwell on past defeats it seemed the only message he got from atticus was insight into the art of cross examination
78,scout we aint gonna do anything were just goin to the street light and back
204,we strolled silently down the sidewalk listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood listening to the soft nightmurmurs of the grown people on our street
55,occasionally we heard miss stephanie crawford laugh
14,okay said jem
32,why dont you go on home scout
21,what are you gonna do
250,dill and jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at boo radley and if i didnt want to go with them i could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut that was all
58,but what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight
337,because nobody could see them at night because atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldnt hear the kingdom coming because if boo radley killed them theyd miss school instead of vacation and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime did i understand
151,jem please   scout im tellin you for the last time shut your trap or go home  i declare to the lord youre gettin more like a girl every day
42,with that i had no option but to join them
133,we thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the radley lot we stood less chance of being seen
67,the fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse
59,jem held up the bottom wire and motioned dill under it
41,i followed and held up the wire for jem
35,it was a tight squeeze for him
32,dont make a sound he whispered
77,dont get in a row of collards whatever you do theyll wake the dead
63,with this thought in mind i made perhaps one step per minute
73,i moved faster when i saw jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight
67,we came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard
14,jem touched it
20,the gate squeaked
27,spit on it whispered dill
39,youve got us in a box jem i muttered
31,we cant get out of here so easy
16,spit on it scout
112,we spat ourselves dry and jem opened the gate slowly lifting it aside and resting it on the fence
23,we were in the back yard
184,the back of the radley house was less inviting than the front a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors
69,instead of a column a rough twobyfour supported one end of the roof
118,an old franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch above it a hatrack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily
42,arr said jem softly lifting his foot
23,chickens he breathed
145,that we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when dill ahead of us spelled god in a whisper
88,we crept to the side of the house around to the window with the hanging shutter
44,the sill was several inches taller than jem
40,give you a hand up he muttered to dill
11,wait though
141,jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist i grabbed my left wrist and jems right wrist we crouched and dill sat on our saddle
45,we raised him and he caught the window sill
45,hurry jem whispered we cant last much longer
62,dill punched my shoulder and we lowered him to the ground
10,whatdyousee
59,theres a little teeny light way off somewhere though
38,lets get away from here breathed jem
29,lets go round in back again
43,shh he warned me as i was about to protest
24,lets try the back window
13,dill no i said
33,dill stopped and let jem go ahead
61,when jem put his foot on the bottom step the step squeaked
53,he stood still then tried his weight by degrees
20,the step was silent
110,jem skipped two steps put his foot on the porch heaved himself to it and teetered a long moment
49,he regained his balance and dropped to his knees
58,he crawled to the window raised his head and looked in
21,then i saw the shadow
49,it was the shadow of a man with a hat on
100,at first i thought it was a tree but there was no wind blowing and treetrunks never walked
113,the back porch was bathed in moonlight and the shadow crisp as toast moved across the porch toward jem
15,dill saw it next
29,he put his hands to his face
33,when it crossed jem jem saw it
49,he put his arms over his head and went rigid
42,the shadow stopped about a foot beyond jem
58,its arm came out from its side dropped and was still
140,then it turned and moved back across jem walked along the porch and off the side of the house returning as it had come
49,jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us
109,he flung open the gate danced dill and me through and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards
104,halfway through the collards i tripped as i tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood
29,dill and jem dived beside me
52,jems breath came in sobs fence by the schoolyard
12, hurry scout
181,jem held the bottom wire dill and i rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyards solitary oak when we sensed that jem was not with us
93,we ran back and found him struggling in the fence kicking his pants off to get loose
39,he ran to the oak tree in his shorts
110,safely behind it we gave way to numbness but jems mind was racing we gotta get home theyll miss us
199,we ran across the schoolyard crawled under the fence to deers pasture behind our house climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before jem would let us pause to rest
99,respiration normal the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard
90,we looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the radley front gate
35,we better go down there said jem
41,theyll think its funny if we dont show up
87,mr nathan radley was standing inside his gate a shotgun broken across his arm
70,atticus was standing beside miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford
39,miss rachel and mr avery were near by
29,none of them saw us come up
50,we eased in beside miss maudie who looked around
51,where were you all didnt you hear the commotion
14,what happened
46,mr radley shot at a negro in his collard patch
14,did he hit him
22,no said miss stephanie
16,shot in the air
22,scared him pale though
59,says if anybody sees a white nigger around thats the one
154,says hes got the other barrel waitin for the next sound he hears in that patch an next time he wont aim high be it dog nigger or  jem finch
13,atticus spoke
21,wherere your pants son
14,it was no use
39,in his shorts before god and everybody
124,in the glare from the streetlight i could see dill hatching one his eyes widened his fat cherub face grew rounder
15,what is it dill
15,asked atticus
39,ah  i won em from him he said vaguely
41,dills hand sought the back of his head
50,he brought it forward and across his forehead
65,we were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool he said
17,jem and i relaxed
49,the neighbors seemed satisfied they all stiffened
24,but what was strip poker
102,we had no chance to find out miss rachel went off like the town fire siren do oo jeesus dill harris
22,gamblin by my fishpool
23,ill strippoker you sir
47,atticus saved dill from immediate dismemberment
33,just a minute miss rachel he said
39,ive never heard of em doing that before
27,were you all playing cards
69,jem fielded dills fly with his eyes shut no sir just with matches
21,i admired my brother
50,matches were dangerous but cards were fatal
70,jem scout said atticus i dont want to hear of poker in any form again
35,go by dills and get your pants jem
21,settle it yourselves
90,dont worry dill said jem as we trotted up the sidewalk she aint gonna get you
25,hell talk her out of it
29,that was fast thinkin son
35,we stopped and heard atticuss voice
10,not serious
81,they all go through it miss rachel dill was comforted but jem and i werent
75,there was the problem of jem showing up some pants in the morning
72,d give you some of mine said dill as we came to miss rachels steps
50,jem said he couldnt get in them but thanks anyway
49,we said goodbye and dill went inside the house
113,he evidently remembered he was engaged to me for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of jem
16,yawl write hear
20,he bawled after us
76,had jems pants been safely on him we would not have slept much anyway
417,every nightsound i heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three fold every scratch of feet on gravel was boo radley seeking revenge every passing negro laughing in the night was boo radley loose and after us insects splashing against the screen were boo radleys insane fingers picking the wire to pieces the chinaberry trees were malignant hovering alive
73,i lingered between sleep and wakefulness until i heard jem murmur
23,sleep little threeeyes
13,are you crazy
24,shh atticuss lights out
64,in the waning moonlight i saw jem swing his feet to the floor
25,im goin after em he said
14,i sat upright
14,i wont let you
36,he was struggling into his shirt
30,you do an ill wake up atticus
24,you do and ill kill you
41,i pulled him down beside me on the cot
28,i tried to reason with him
45,mr nathans gonna find em in the morning jem
20,he knows you lost em
81,when he shows em to atticus itll be pretty bad thats all there is to it
15,gon back to bed
26,thats what i know said jem
28,thats why im goin after em
22,i began to feel sick
169,going back to that place by himself  i remembered miss stephanie mr nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard be it nigger dog
73,jem knew that better than i i was desperate look it aint worth it jem
37,a lickin hurts but it doesnt last
34,youll get your head shot off jem
35,he blew out his breath patiently
35,i  its like this scout he muttered
52,atticus aint ever whipped me since i can remember
24,i wanta keep it that way
18,this was a thought
56,it seemed that atticus threatened us every other day
40,you mean hes never caught you at anything
51,maybe so but  i just wanta keep it that way scout
36,we shouldna done that tonight scout
67,it was then i suppose that jem and i first began to part company
92,sometimes i did not understand him but my periods of bewilderment were shortlived
19,this was beyond me
114,please i pleaded cantcha just think about it for a minute  by yourself on that place   shut up
56,its not like hed never speak to you again or somethin
100,im gonna wake him up jem i swear i am   jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight
32,then im goin with you   i choked
33,no you aint youll just make noise
12,it was no use
75,i unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps
30,it must have been two oclock
92,the moon was setting and the latticework shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness
105,jems white shirttail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning
76,a faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides
157,he went the back way through deers pasture across the schoolyard and around to the fence i thought  at least that was the way he was headed
53,it would take longer so it was not time to worry yet
75,i waited until it was time to worry and listened for mr radleys shotgun
50,then i thought i heard the back fence squeak
25,it was wishful thinking
26,then i heard atticus cough
16,i held my breath
98,sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading
94,he said he often woke up during the night checked on us and read himself back to sleep
78,i waited for his light to go on straining my eyes to see it flood the hall
35,it stayed off and i breathed again
172,the nightcrawlers had retired but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs
30,there he was returning to me
69,his white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger
76,he came up the back steps latched the door behind him and sat on his cot
35,wordlessly he held up his pants
59,he lay down and for a while i heard his cot trembling
17,soon he was still
29,i did not hear him stir again
79,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  jem stayed moody and silent for a week
231,as atticus had once advised me to do i tried to climb into jems skin and walk around in it if i had gone alone to the radley place at two in the morning my funeral would have been held the next afternoon
51,so i left jem alone and tried not to bother him
15,school started
137,the second grade was as bad as the first only worse  they still flashed cards at you and wouldnt let you read or write
194,miss carolines progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter however the usual crew had flunked the first grade again and were helpful in keeping order
152,the only thing good about the second grade was that this year i had to stay as late as jem and we usually walked home together at three oclock
131,one afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home jem suddenly said theres something i didnt tell you
89,as this was his first complete sentence in several days i encouraged him about what
16,about that night
56,youve never told me anything about that night i said
46,jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats
166,he was silent for a while then he said when i went back for my breeches  they were all in a tangle when i was gettin out of em i couldnt get em loose
44,when i went back   jem took a deep breath
49,when i went back they were folded across the fence
29,like they were expectin me
50,across and something else   jems voice was flat
25,show you when we get home
19,theyd been sewed up
58,not like a lady sewed em like somethin id try to do
11,all crooked
63,its almost like     somebody knew you were comin back for em
12,jem shuddered
85,like somebody was readin my mind like somebody could tell what i was gonna do
75,cant anybody tell what im gonna do lest they know me can they scout
28,jems question was an appeal
125,i reassured him cant anybody tell what youre gonna do lest they live in the house with you and even i cant tell sometimes
29,we were walking past our tree
45,in its knothole rested a ball of gray twine
24,dont take it jem i said
31,this is somebodys hidin place
23,i dont think so scout
148,somebody like walter cunningham comes down here every recess and hides his things  and we come along and take em away from him
48,listen lets leave it and wait a couple of days
37,if it aint gone then well take it okay
36,okay you might be right said jem
75,it must be some little kids place  hides his things from the bigger folks
64,you know its only when schools in that weve found things
63,yeah i said but we never go by here in the summertime
12,we went home
50,next morning the twine was where we had left it
60,when it was still there on the third day jem pocketed it
86,from then on we considered everything we found in the knothole our property
263, the second grade was grim but jem assured me that the older i got the better school would be that he started off the same way and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value
276,the sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning he went through a brief egyptian period that baffled me  he tried to walk flat a great deal sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him putting one foot behind the other
293,he declared egyptians walked that way i said if they did i didnt see how they got anything done but jem said they accomplished more than the americans ever did they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming and asked where would we be today if they hadnt
72,atticus told me to delete the adjectives and id have the facts
214,there are no clearly defined seasons in south alabama summer drifts into autumn and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter but turns to a days old spring that melts into summer again
66,that fall was a long one hardly cool enough for a light jacket
107,jem and i were trotting in our orbit one mild october afternoon when our knothole stopped us again
39,something white was inside this time
75,jem let me do the honors i pulled out two small images carved in soap
60,one was the figure of a boy the other wore a crude dress
105,before i remembered that there was no such thing as hoodooing i shrieked and threw them down
20,jem snatched them up
25,whats the matter with you
38,he rubbed the figures free of red dust
22,these are good he said
31,ive never seen any these good
24,he held them down to me
51,they were almost perfect miniatures of two children
77,the boy had on shorts and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows
19,i looked up at jem
65,a point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part
33,i had never noticed it before
38,jem looked from the girldoll to me
24,the girldoll wore bangs
20,these are us he said
24,who did em you reckon
43,who do we know around here who whittles
29,mr avery just does like this
11,i mean carves
106,mr avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it
63,theres old miss stephanie crawfords sweetheart i said
51,he carves all right but he lives down the country
46,when would he ever pay any attention to us
69,maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of miss stephanie
20,if i was him i would
97,jem stared at me so long i asked what was the matter but got nothing scout for an answer
49,when we went home jem put the dolls in his trunk
179,less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum which we enjoyed the fact that everything on the radley place was poison having slipped jems memory
61,the following week the knothole yielded a tarnished medal
181,jem showed it to atticus who said it was a spelling medal that before we were born the maycomb county schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners
69,atticus said someone must have lost it and had we asked around
64,jem camelkicked me when i tried to say where we had found it
87,jem asked atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one and atticus said no
44,our biggest prize appeared four days later
78,it was a pocket watch that wouldnt run on a chain with an aluminum knife
29,you reckon its white gold jem
23,ill show it to atticus
95,atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars knife chain and all if it were new
38,did you swap with somebody at school
121,jem pulled out his grandfathers watch that atticus let him carry once a week if jem were careful with it
55,on the days he carried the watch jem walked on eggs
67,atticus if its all right with you id rather have this one instead
20,maybe i can fix it
185,when the new wore off his grandfathers watch and carrying it became a days burdensome task jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes
101,he did a fair job only one spring and two tiny pieces left over but the watch would not run
28,ohh he sighed itll never go
75,you reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever s leaving us these things
54,thatd be right nice jem we can thank em  whats wrong
68,jem was holding his ears shaking his head from side to side
59,i dont get it i just dont get it  i dont know why scout
34,he looked toward the livingroom
59,ive gotta good mind to tell atticus  no i reckon not
21,ill tell him for you
22,no dont do that scout
164,he had been on the verge of telling me something all evening his face would brighten and he would lean toward me then he would change his mind
20,he changed it again
24,here lets write a letter
44,i pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose
40,dear mister how do you know its a man
59,i bet its miss maudie  been bettin that for a long time
53,arr miss maudie cant chew gum   jem broke into a grin
45,you know she can talk real pretty sometimes
160,one time i asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks that  chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless said jem carefully
23,doesnt that sound nice
38,yeah she can say nice things sometimes
47,she wouldnt have a watch and chain anyway
18,dear sir said jem
93,we appreciate the  no we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for us
42,yours very truly jeremy atticus finch
59,he wont know who you are if you sign it like that jem
45,jem erased his name and wrote jem finch
45,i signed jean louise finch scout beneath it
34,jem put the note in an envelope
85,next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree
65,jem was facing me when he looked up and i saw him go stark white
11,i ran to him
43,someone had filled our knothole with cement
22,dont you cry now scout
73,dont cry now dont you worry he muttered at me all the way to school
96,when we went home for dinner jem bolted his food ran to the porch and stood on the steps
14,i followed him
28,hasnt passed by yet he said
50,next day jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded
27,hidy do mr nathan he said
49,morning jem scout said mr radley as he went by
19,mr radley said jem
22,mr radley turned around
74,mr radley ah  did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder
11,yes he said
14,i filled it up
16,whydyoudoit sir
12,trees dying
41,you plug em with cement when theyre sick
27,you ought to know that jem
57,jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon
100,when we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement and remained deep in thought
76,he seemed to be working himself into a bad humor so i kept my distance
61,as usual we met atticus coming home from work that evening
95,when we were at our steps jem said atticus look down yonder at that tree please sir
13,what tree son
64,the one on the corner of the radley lot comin from school
17,is that tree dyin
27,why no son i dont think so
99,look at the leaves theyre all green and full no brown patches anywhere   it aint even sick
38,that trees as healthy as you are jem
32,mr nathan radley said it was dyin
16,well maybe it is
57,im sure mr radley knows more about his trees than we do
34,atticus left us on the porch
57,jem leaned on a pillar rubbing his shoulders against it
14,do you itch jem
33,i asked as politely as i could
17,he did not answer
21,come on in jem i said
12,after while
51,he stood there until nightfall and i waited for him
158,when we went in the house i saw he had been crying his face was dirty in the right places but i thought it odd that i had not heard him
162,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  for reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in maycomb county autumn turned to winter that year
63,we had two weeks of the coldest weather since  atticus said
387,mr avery said it was written on the rosetta stone that when children disobeyed their parents smoked cigarettes and made war on each other the seasons would change jem and i were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves
157,old mrs radley died that winter but her death caused hardly a ripple  the neighborhood seldom saw her except when she watered her carinas
164,jem and i decided that boo had got her at last but when atticus returned from the radley house he said she died of natural causes to our disappointment
21,ask him jem whispered
30,you ask him youre the oldest
30,thats why you oughta ask him
28,atticus i said did you see mr
60,atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me i did not
43,jem restrained me from further questions
103,he said atticus was still touchous about us and the radleys and it wouldnt do to push him any
137,jem had a notion that atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker
68,jem had no firm basis for his ideas he said it was merely a twitch
75,next morning i awoke looked out the window and nearly died of fright
60,my screams brought atticus from his bathroom halfshaven
22,the worlds endin atticus
20,please do something
40,i dragged him to the window and pointed
19,no its not he said
11,its snowing
38,jem asked atticus would it keep up
56,jem had never seen snow either but he knew what it was
64,atticus said he didnt know any more about snow than jem did
59,i think though if its watery like that itll turn to rain
77,the telephone rang and atticus left the breakfast table to answer it
46,that was eula may he said when he returned
92,i quote  as it has not snowed in maycomb county since  there will be no school today
50,eula may was maycomb s leading telephone operator
174,she was entrusted with issuing public announcements wedding invitations setting off the fire siren and giving firstaid instructions when dr reynolds was away
149,when atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of out the windows jem asked how do you make a snowman
42,i havent the slightest idea said atticus
102,i dont want you all to be disappointed but i doubt if therell be enough snow for a snowball even
61,calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking
80,when we ran to the back yard it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow
39,we shouldnt walk about in it said jem
38,look every step you takes wasting it
38,i looked back at my mushy footprints
93,jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman
49,i stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake
11,jem its hot
30,no it aint its so cold it burns
38,now dont eat it scout youre wasting it
17,let it come down
24,but i want to walk in it
52,i know what we can go walk over at miss maudies
34,jem hopped across the front yard
26,i followed in his tracks
86,when we were on the sidewalk in front of miss maudies mr avery accosted us
51,he had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt
20,see what youve done
45,hasnt snowed in maycomb since appomattox
52,its bad children like you makes the seasons change
200,i wondered if mr avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance and reflected that if this was our reward there was something to say for sin
124,i did not wonder where mr avery gathered his meteorological statistics they came straight from the rosetta stone
23,jem finch you jem finch
28,miss maudies callin you jem
41,you all stay in the middle of the yard
62,theres some thrift buried under the snow near the porch
14,dont step on it
35,its beautiful aint it miss maudie
21,beautiful my hind foot
54,if it freezes tonight itll carry off all my azaleas
54,miss maudies old sunhat glistened with snow crystals
75,she was bending over some small bushes wrapping them in burlap bags
43,jem asked her what she was doing that for
25,keep em warm she said
27,how can flowers keep warm
19,they dont circulate
42,i cannot answer that question jem finch
84,all i know is if it freezes tonight these plantsll freeze so you cover em up
14,is that clear
11,miss maudie
44,could scout and me borrow some of your snow
25,heavens alive take it all
66,theres an old peach basket under the house haul it off in that
26,miss maudies eyes narrowed
51,jem finch what are you going to do with my snow
132,youll see said jem and we transferred as much snow as we could from miss maudies yard to ours a slushy operation
25,what are we gonna do jem
18,youll see he said
94,now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front
47,walk back in your tracks though he cautioned
36,are we gonna have a snow baby jem
15,no a real snowman
19,gotta work hard now
148,jem ran to the back yard produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile placing any worms he found to one side
122,he went in the house returned with the laundry hamper filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard
99,when we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow jem said we were ready to begin
40,dont you think this is kind of a mess
44,looks messy now but it wont later he said
146,jem scooped up an armful of dirt patted it into a mound on which he added another load and another until he had constructed a torso
48,jem i aint ever heard of a nigger snowman i said
34,he wont be black long he grunted
129,jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard plaited them and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt
74,he looks like stephanie crawford with her hands on her hips i said
43,fat in the middle and littlebitty arms
16,ill make em bigger
57,jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt
104,he looked thoughtfully at it for a moment then he molded a big stomach below the figures waistline
90,jem glanced at me his eyes twinkling mr averys sort of shaped like a snowman aint he
55,jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on
80,he permitted me to cover only the back saving the public parts for himself
35,gradually mr avery turned white
106,using bits of wood for eyes nose mouth and buttons jem succeeded in making mr avery look cross
43,a stick of stovewood completed the picture
38,jem stepped back and viewed his creation
21,its lovely jem i said
34,looks almost like hed talk to you
13,it is aint it
12,he said shyly
112,we could not wait for atticus to come home for dinner but called and said we had a big surprise for him
130,he seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard but he said we had done a jimdandy job
156,i didnt know how you were going to do it he said to jem but from now on ill never worry about whatll become of you son youll always have an idea
109,jems ears reddened from atticuss compliment but he looked up sharply when he saw atticus stepping back
41,atticus squinted at the snowman a while
27,he grinned then laughed
89,son i cant tell what youre going to be  an engineer a lawyer or a portrait painter
56,youve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard
36,weve got to disguise this fellow
130,atticus suggested that jem hone down his creations front a little swap a broom for the stovewood and put an apron on him
89,jem explained that if he did the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman
67,i dont care what you do so long as you do something said atticus
62,you cant go around making caricatures of the neighbors
30,aint a characterture said jem
23,it looks just like him
28,mr avery might not think so
11,i know what
98,he raced across the street disappeared into miss maudies back yard and returned triumphant
106,he stuck her sunhat on the snowmans head and jammed her hedgeclippers into the crook of his arm
29,atticus said that would be fine
62,miss maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch
36,she looked across the street at us
20,suddenly she grinned
21,jem finch she called
37,you devil bring me back my hat sir
46,jem looked up at atticus who shook his head
24,shes just fussing he said
49,shes really impressed with your  accomplishments
145,atticus strolled over to miss maudies sidewalk where they engaged in an arm waving conversation the only phrase of which i caught was
46,erected an absolute morphodite in that yard
30,atticus youll never raise em
206,the snow stopped in the afternoon the temperature dropped and by nightfall mr averys direst predictions came true calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing but we were cold
155,when atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it and asked calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night
116,calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought shed be warmer at her house
32,atticus drove her home in the car
70,before i went to sleep atticus put more coal on the fire in my room
154,he said the thermometer registered sixteen that it was the coldest night in his memory and that our snowman outside was frozen solid
66,minutes later it seemed i was awakened by someone shaking me
39,atticus s overcoat was spread across me
24,is it morning already
11,baby get up
44,atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat
31,put your robe on first he said
52,jem was standing beside atticus groggy and tousled
97,he was holding his overcoat closed at the neck his other hand was jammed into his pocket
33,he looked strangely overweight
24,hurry hon said atticus
31,herere your shoes and socks
22,stupidly i put them on
13,is it morning
26,no its a little after one
58,that something was wrong finally got through to me
15,whats the matter
35,by then he did not have to tell me
100,just as the birds know where to go when it rains i knew when there was trouble in our street
91,soft taffetalike sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread
11,whose is it
37,miss maudies hon said atticus gently
77,at the front door we saw fire spewing from miss maudies diningroom windows
123,as if to confirm what we saw the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there screaming
14,its gone aint it
26,i expect so said atticus
23,now listen both of you
47,go down and stand in front of the radley place
32,keep out of the way do you hear
34,see which way the winds blowing
11,oh said jem
57,atticus reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out
10,not yet son
16,do as i tell you
28,take care of scout you hear
31,dont let her out of your sight
59,with a push atticus started us toward the radley front gate
109,we stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured miss maudies house
44,why dont they hurry why dont they hurry
12,muttered jem
95,the old fire truck killed by the cold was being pushed from town by a crowd of men
118,when the men attached its hose to a hydrant the hose burst and water shot up tinkling down on the pavement
41,ohh lord jem jem put his arm around me
20,hush scout he said
26,it aint time to worry yet
22,ill let you know when
136,the men of maycomb in all degrees of dress and undress took furniture from miss maudies house to a yard across the street
130,i saw atticus carrying miss maudies heavy oak rocking chair and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most
28,sometimes we heard shouts
52,then mr averys face appeared in an upstairs window
130,he pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted come down from there dick
20,the stairs are going
19,get outta there mr
46,mr avery began climbing through the window
15,scout hes stuck
12,breathed jem
28,mr avery was wedged tightly
100,i buried my head under jems arm and didnt look again until jem cried hes got loose scout
14,hes all right
56,i looked up to see mr avery cross the upstairs porch
87,he swung his legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped
49,he fell yelled and hit miss maudies shrubbery
129,suddenly i noticed that the men were backing away from miss maudies house moving down the street toward us
41,they were no longer carrying furniture
136,the fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof window frames were black against a vivid orange center
41,jem it looks like a pumpkin   scout look
133,smoke was rolling off our house and miss rachels house like fog off a riverbank and men were pulling hoses toward them
115,behind us the fire truck from abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house
18,that book i said
46,that tom swift book it aint mine its dills
55,dont worry scout it aint time to worry yet said jem
13,looka yonder
89,in a group of neighbors atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets
46,he might have been watching a football game
28,miss maudie was beside him
42,see there hes not worried yet said jem
37,why aint he on top of one of the houses
34,hes too old hed break his neck
51,you think we oughta make him get our stuff out
55,lets dont pester him hell know when its time said jem
140,the abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house a man on the roof pointed to places that needed it most
111,i watched our absolute morphodite go black and crumble miss maudies sunhat settled on top of the heap
33,i could not see her hedgeclippers
119,in the heat between our house miss rachels and miss maudies the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes
139,they worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants but i became aware that i was slowly freezing where i stood
54,jem tried to keep me warm but his arm was not enough
49,i pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders
42,by dancing a little i could feel my feet
80,another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of miss stephanie crawfords
108,there was no hydrant for another hose and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguishers
42,miss maudies tin roof quelled the flames
197,roaring the house collapsed fire gushed everywhere followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood
78,it was dawn before the men began to leave first one by one then in groups
113,they pushed the maycomb fire truck back to town the abbottsville truck departed the third one remained
76,we found out next day it had come from clarks ferry sixty miles away
34,jem and i slid across the street
145,miss maudie was staring at the smoking black hole in her yard and atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk
68,he led us home holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street
72,he said miss maudie would stay with miss stephanie for the time being
33,anybody want some hot chocolate
69,i shuddered when atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove
103,as we drank our cocoa i noticed atticus looking at me first with curiosity then with sternness
52,i thought i told you and jem to stay put he said
37,we stayed then whose blanket is that
16,yes maam blanket
13,it isnt ours
128,i looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket i was wearing around my shoulders squawfashion
23,atticus i dont know sir
78,i   i turned to jem for an answer but jem was even more bewildered than i
189,he said he didnt know how it got there we did exactly as atticus had told us we stood down by the radley gate away from everybody we didnt move an inch  jem stopped
108,mr nathan was at the fire he babbled i saw him i saw him he was tuggin that mattress  atticus i swear
19,thats all right son
22,atticus grinned slowly
70,looks like all of maycomb was out tonight in one way or another
70,jem theres some wrapping paper in the pantry i think
38,go get it and well   atticus no sir
33,jem seemed to have lost his mind
154,he began pouring out our secrets right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own omitting nothing knothole pants and all
303,nathan put cement in that tree atticus an he did it to stop us findin things  hes crazy i reckon like they say but atticus i swear to god he aint ever harmed us he aint ever hurt us he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants instead
100,he aint ever hurt us atticus   atticus said whoa son so gently that i was greatly heartened
103,it was obvious that he had not followed a word jem said for all atticus said was youre right
50,wed better keep this and the blanket to ourselves
58,someday maybe scout can thank him for covering her up
104,you were so busy looking at the fire you didnt know it when he put the blanket around you
110,my stomach turned to water and i nearly threw up when jem held out the blanket and crept toward me
77,he sneaked out of the house  turn round  sneaked up an went like this
76,atticus said dryly do not let this inspire you to further glory jeremy
110,jem scowled i aint gonna do anything to him but i watched the spark of fresh adventure leave his eyes
70,just think scout he said if youd just turned around you da seen him
27,calpurnia woke us at noon
90,atticus had said we need not go to school that day wed learn nothing after no sleep
61,calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard
146,miss maudies sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice like a fly in amber and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedgeclippers
70,we found her in her back yard gazing at her frozen charred azaleas
51,were bringing back your things miss maudie said jem
18,were awful sorry
77,miss maudie looked around and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face
40,always wanted a smaller house jem finch
19,gives me more yard
49,just think ill have more room for my azaleas now
30,you aint grievin miss maudie
18,i asked surprised
49,atticus said her house was nearly all she had
15,grieving child
30,why i hated that old cow barn
81,thought of settin fire to it a hundred times myself except theyd lock me up
49,but dont you worry about me jean louise finch
55,there are ways of doing things you dont know about
118,why ill build me a little house and take me a couple of roomers and  gracious ill have the finest yard in alabama
58,those bellingrathsll look plain puny when i get started
29,jem and i looked at each other
25,howd it catch miss maudie
16,i dont know jem
33,probably the flue in the kitchen
58,i kept a fire in there last night for my potted plants
74,hear you had some unexpected company last night miss jean louise
13,howd you know
50,atticus told me on his way to town this morning
48,tell you the truth id like tove been with you
41,and idve had sense enough to turn around too
20,miss maudie puzzled me
145,with most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard a shambles she still took a lively and cordial interest in jems and my affairs
33,she must have seen my perplexity
95,she said only thing i worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused
42,this whole neighborhood could have gone up
55,mr averyll be in bed for a week  hes right stove up
57,hes too old to do things like that and i told him so
107,soon as i can get my hands clean and when stephanie crawfords not looking ill make him a lane cake
187,that stephanies been after my recipe for thirty years and if she thinks ill give it to her just because im staying with her shes got another think coming
112,i reflected that if miss maudie broke down and gave it to her miss stephanie couldnt follow it anyway
108,miss maudie had once let me see it among other things the recipe called for one large cup of sugar
19,it was a still day
121,the air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank rattle and strain before it struck the hour
87,miss maudie s nose was a color i had never seen before and i inquired about it
46,ive been out here since six oclock she said
23,should be frozen by now
21,she held up her hands
85,a network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms brown with dirt and dried blood
26,youve ruined em said jem
30,why dont you get a colored man
92,there was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added or scoutnme we can help you
83,miss maudie said thank you sir but youve got a job of your own over there
25,she pointed to our yard
24,you mean the morphodite
37,shoot we can rake him up in a jiffy
58,miss maudie stared down at me her lips moving silently
56,suddenly she put her hands to her head and whooped
42,when we left her she was still chuckling
89,jem said he didnt know what was the matter with her  that was just miss maudie
69,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  you can just take that back boy
99,this order given by me to cecil jacobs was the beginning of a rather thin time for jem and me
50,my fists were clenched and i was ready to let fly
241,atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more i was far too old and too big for such childish things and the sooner i learned to hold in the better off everybody would be
13,i soon forgot
28,cecil jacobs made me forget
96,he had announced in the schoolyard the day before that scout finchs daddy defended niggers
25,i denied it but told jem
24,whatd he mean sayin that
16,nothing jem said
24,ask atticus hell tell you
31,do you defend niggers atticus
24,i asked him that evening
12,of course i do
22,dont say nigger scout
11,thats common
32,s what everybody at school says
128,from now on itll be everybody less one   well if you dont want me to grow up talkin that way why do you send me to school
56,my father looked at me mildly amusement in his eyes
253,despite our compromise my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first days dose of it the beginning of last september had brought on sinking spells dizziness and mild gastric complaints
188,i went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of miss rachels cooks son who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm
12,it didnt take
33,but i was worrying another bone
41,do all lawyers defend nnegroes atticus
25,of course they do scout
47,then why did cecil say you defended niggers
