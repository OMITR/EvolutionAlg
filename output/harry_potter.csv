193,harry potter and the sorcerers stonechapter onethe boy who livedmr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much
145,they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense
76,mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills
93,he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache
225,mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors
101,the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere
137,the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it
81,they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters
247,mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be
102,the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street
92,the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him
126,this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like that
236,when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country
172,mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair
70,none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window
243,at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls
56,little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house
64,he got into his car and backed out of number fours drive
124,it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar  a cat reading a map
112,for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen  then he jerked his head around to look again
97,there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight
37,what could he have been thinking of
42,it must have been a trick of the light
45,mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat
15,it stared back
96,as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror
114,it was now reading the sign that said privet drive  no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs
81,mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind
111,as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day
85,but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else
143,as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about
17,people in cloaks
106,mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes  the getups you saw on young people
49,he supposed this was some stupid new fashion
126,he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by
40,they were whispering excitedly together
166,mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak
17,the nerve of him
159,but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it
136,the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills
89,mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor
85,if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning
169,he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead
56,most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime
62,mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning
35,he yelled at five different people
68,he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more
163,he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery
109,hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers
39,he eyed them angrily as he passed
43,he didnt know why but they made him uneasy
90,this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin
138,it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying
97,the potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harrymr dursley stopped dead
15,fear flooded him
103,he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it
215,he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind
98,he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid
34,potter wasnt such an unusual name
85,he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry
70,come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry
28,hed never even seen the boy
26,it might have been harvey
109,there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister
95,he didnt blame her  if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks
219,he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door
67,sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell
96,it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak
67,he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground
175,on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today
43,rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last
74,even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day
73,and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off
37,mr dursley stood rooted to the spot
45,he had been hugged by a complete stranger
64,he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was
14,he was rattled
167,he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imagination
159,as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw  and it didnt improve his mood  was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning
39,it was now sitting on his garden wall
76,he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes
23,said mr dursley loudly
16,the cat didnt move
29,it just gave him a stern look
29,was this normal cat behavior
21,mr dursley wondered
67,trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house
65,he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife
42,mrs dursley had had a nice normal day
133,she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont
33,mr dursley tried to act normally
249,when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today
192,although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise
97,experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern
40,the newscaster allowed himself a grin
16,most mysterious
55,and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather
51,going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim
118,well ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today
181,viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars
96,perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early  its not until next week folks
37,but i can promise a wet night tonight
39,mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair
32,shooting stars all over britain
25,owls flying by daylight
48,mysterious people in cloaks all over the place
116,and a whisper a whisper about the pottersmrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea
14,it was no good
37,hed have to say something to her
33,he cleared his throat nervously
75,er  petunia dear  you havent heard from your sister lately have you
56,as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry
60,after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sister
18,no she said sharply
44,funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled
88,owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town todayso
17,snapped mrs dursley
77,well i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd
50,mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips
75,mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter
24,he decided he didnt dare
96,instead he said as casually as he could their son  hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he
40,i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly
18,whats his name again
15,howard isnt it
32,nasty common name if you ask me
48,oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly
17,yes i quite agree
74,he didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed
120,while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden
26,the cat was still there
78,it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something
25,was he imagining things
56,could all this have anything to do with the potters
108,if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of  well he didnt think he could bear it
26,the dursleys got into bed
98,mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind
173,his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley
84,the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind
191,he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on  he yawned and turned over  it couldnt affect themhow very wrong he was
135,mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness
108,it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive
115,it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead
61,in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all
164,a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground
49,the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed
62,nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive
138,he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt
103,he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots
174,his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice
37,this mans name was albus dumbledore
143,albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome
59,he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something
169,but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street
63,for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him
48,he chuckled and muttered i should have known
56,he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket
49,it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter
60,he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it
58,the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop
60,he clicked it again  the next lamp flickered into darkness
180,twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him
154,if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement
163,dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat
57,he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to it
44,fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall
54,he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone
169,instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes
45,she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one
45,her black hair was drawn into a tight bun
33,she looked distinctly ruffled
27,how did you know it was me
56,my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly
88,youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall
38,when you could have been celebrating
66,i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here
41,professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily
64,oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently
102,youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no  even the muggles have noticed somethings going on
21,it was on their news
62,she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window
74,flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid
40,they were bound to notice something
64,shooting stars down in kent  ill bet that was dedalus diggle
20,he never had much sense
45,you cant blame them said dumbledore gently
60,weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years
52,i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably
40,but thats no reason to lose our heads
135,people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors
143,she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on
136,a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all
43,i suppose he really has gone dumbledore
39,it certainly seems so said dumbledore
33,we have much to be thankful for
34,would you care for a lemon drop
13,a lemon drop
175,theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond ofno thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops
128,as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name
152,all this you knowwho nonsense  for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort
114,professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice
58,it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho
74,i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name
92,i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring
20,but youre different
95,everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened of
44,you flatter me said dumbledore calmly
38,voldemort had powers i will never have
48,only because youre too  well  noble to use them
19,its lucky its dark
84,i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs
138,professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around
30,you know what everyones saying
26,about why hes disappeared
28,about what finally stopped him
275,it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now
129,it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true
78,dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer
97,what theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow
29,he went to find the potters
72,the rumor is that lily and james potter are  are  that theyre  dead
26,dumbledore bowed his head
30,professor mcgonagall gasped
15,lily and james
16,i cant believe it
99,i didnt want to believe itoh albusdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder
23,i know he said heavily
51,professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on
14,thats not all
55,theyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry
14,but  he couldnt
33,he couldnt kill that little boy
149,no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke  and thats why hes gone
22,dumbledore nodded glumly
12,its  its true
32,faltered professor mcgonagall
79,after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy
101,its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survive
33,we can only guess said dumbledore
18,we may never know
105,professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles
92,dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it
23,it was a very odd watch
98,it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge
112,it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late
62,i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the way
30,yes said professor mcgonagall
74,and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all places
49,ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle
42,theyre the only family he has left now
57,you dont mean  you cant mean the people who live here
80,cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four
21,dumbledore  you cant
31,ive been watching them all day
59,you couldnt find two people who are less like us
108,and theyve got this son  i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets
34,harry potter come and live here
52,its the best place for him said dumbledore firmly
80,his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older
24,ive written them a letter
69,repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall
68,really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter
40,these people will never understand him
225,hell be famous  a legend  i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future  there will be books written about harry  every child in our world will know his name
90,exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses
43,it would be enough to turn any boys head
34,famous before he can walk and talk
45,famous for something he wont even remember
110,cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it
122,professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes  yes youre right of course
47,but how is the boy getting here dumbledore
92,she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it
21,hagrids bringing him
81,you think it  wise  to trust hagrid with something as important as this
52,i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore
141,im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless
31,he does tend to  what was that
61,a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them
270,it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them
79,if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it
81,he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide
235,he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild  long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins
66,in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets
43,hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved
37,and where did you get that motorcycle
109,borrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke
33,young sirius black lent it to me
16,ive got him sir
24,no problems were there
116,no sir  house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around
43,he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol
82,dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets
49,inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep
125,under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning
13,is that where
30,whispered professor mcgonagall
19,yes said dumbledore
28,hell have that scar forever
45,couldnt you do something about it dumbledore
26,even if i could i wouldnt
22,scars can come in handy
91,i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground
64,well  give him here hagrid  wed better get this over with
78,dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house
43,could i  could i say goodbye to him sir
13,asked hagrid
110,he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss
56,then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog
50,hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the muggles
100,sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it
338,but i cccant stand it  lily an james dead  an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door
159,he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two
246,for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out
39,well said dumbledore finally thats that
29,weve no business staying here
46,we may as well go and join the celebrations
79,yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back
59,gnight professor mcgonagall  professor dumbledore sir
194,wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night
94,i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her
44,professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply
51,dumbledore turned and walked back down the street
63,on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter
265,he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street
70,he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four
29,good luck harry he murmured
67,he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone
180,a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen
68,harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up
381,one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley
196,he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter  the boy who lived
185,chapter twothe vanishing glassnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all
283,the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls
84,only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed
408,ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets  but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother
74,the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too
75,yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long
100,his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day
23,harry woke with a start
35,his aunt rapped on the door again
11,she screeched
114,harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove
80,he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having
24,it had been a good one
44,there had been a flying motorcycle in it
52,he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream before
37,his aunt was back outside the door
13,are you up yet
12,she demanded
17,nearly said harry
57,well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon
83,and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthday
13,harry groaned
15,what did you say
36,his aunt snapped through the door
62,nothing nothingdudleys birthday  how could he have forgotten
59,harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks
96,he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on
118,harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept
67,when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen
73,the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents
136,it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike
175,exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise  unless of course it involved punching somebody
74,dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him
39,harry didnt look it but he was very fast
134,perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age
182,he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was
78,harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes
135,he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose
147,the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning
149,he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it
55,in the car crash when your parents died she had said
23,and dont ask questions
87,dont ask questions  that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys
72,uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon
14,comb your hair
40,he barked by way of a morning greeting
125,about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut
183,harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way  all over the place
91,harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother
40,dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon
145,he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head
133,aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel  harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig
101,harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room
44,dudley meanwhile was counting his presents
13,his face fell
55,thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father
30,thats two less than last year
113,darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddy
66,all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the face
155,harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over
150,aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today
16,hows that popkin
18,two more presents
51,is that all right dudley thought for a moment
26,it looked like hard work
93,finally he said slowly so ill have thirty  thirtythirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia
56,dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel
14,all right then
24,uncle vernon chuckled
63,little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father
15,atta boy dudley
25,he ruffled dudleys hair
241,at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr
132,he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried
23,bad news vernon she said
25,mrs figgs broken her leg
17,she cant take him
42,she jerked her head in harrys direction
73,dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap
156,every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies
91,every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away
19,harry hated it there
114,the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned
77,said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this
222,harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty again
46,we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested
42,dont be silly vernon she hates the boy
185,the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there  or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slug
45,what about whatshername your friend  yvonne
46,on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia
186,you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computer
64,aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon
44,and come back and find the house in ruins
11,she snarled
63,i wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listening
182,i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the carthat cars new hes not sitting in it alonedudley began to cry loudly
184,in fact he wasnt really crying  it had been years since hed really cried  but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted
70,dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day
39,she cried flinging her arms around him
25,i dont want him ttto come
41,dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs
33,he always sp spoils everything
64,he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms
59,just then the doorbell rang  oh good lord theyre here
124,said aunt petunia frantically  and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother
48,piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat
99,he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them
45,dudley stopped pretending to cry at once
195,half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life
148,his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside
222,im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy  any funny business anything at all  and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmas
50,im not going to do anything said harry honestly
38,but uncle vernon didnt believe him
16,no one ever did
148,the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happen
277,once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar
188,dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses
291,next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly
331,another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls  the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry
107,aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punished
108,on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens
136,dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney
136,the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings
164,but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors
63,harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump
39,but today nothing was going to go wrong
187,it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living room
56,while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia
141,he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects
32,this morning it was motorcycles
94, roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them
66,i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly
13,it was flying
57,uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front
138,he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly
27,dudley and piers sniggered
29,i know they dont said harry
20,it was only a dream
37,but he wished he hadnt said anything
268,if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon  they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas
72,it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families
259,the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop
170,it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond
55,harry had the best morning hed had in a long time
231,he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him
228,they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first
84,harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last
43,after lunch they went to the reptile house
81,it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls
113,behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone
89,dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons
58,dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place
165,it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can  but at the moment it didnt look in the mood
28,in fact it was fast asleep
99,dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils
38,make it move he whined at his father
64,uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge
28,do it again dudley ordered
95,uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on
29,this is boring dudley moaned
16,he shuffled away
72,harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake
193,he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself  no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long
192,it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house
47,the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes
89,slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrys
11,harry stared
61,then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching
9,they werent
45,he looked back at the snake and winked too
100,the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling
71,it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time
91,i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him
25,it must be really annoying
26,the snake nodded vigorously
32,where do you come from anyway
10,harry asked
67,the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass
19,harry peered at it
23,boa constrictor brazil
18,was it nice there
114,the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo
41,oh i see  so youve never been to brazil
92,as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump
29,come and look at this snake
34,you wont believe what its doing
60,dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could
59,out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs
64,caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor
213,what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened  one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror
88,harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished
81,the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor
84,people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits
122,as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigo
48,the keeper of the reptile house was in shock
55,but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go
114,the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again
36,piers and dudley could only gibber
331,as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death
119,but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harry
91,uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry
42,he was so angry he could hardly speak
151,he managed to say go  cupboard  stay  no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy
67,harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch
88,he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet
75,until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food
187,hed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash
67,he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died
188,sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead
103,this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from
40,he couldnt remember his parents at all
98,his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions
49,there were no photographs of them in the house
200,when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family
96,yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him
41,very strange strangers they were too
107,a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley
126,after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything
88,a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus
140,a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word
130,the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look
29,at school harry had no one
168,everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang
126,chapter threethe letters from no onethe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment
309,by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches
119,harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day
139,piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader
98,the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry hunting
183,this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope
143,when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley
77,dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings
35,piers polkiss was going there too
82,harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school
38,dudley thought this was very funny
81,they stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewallhe told harry
37,want to come upstairs and practice
20,no thanks said harry
92,the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it  it might be sick
59,then he ran before dudley could work out what hed said
112,one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs
32,mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual
133,it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before
133,she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years
102,that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform
99,smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters
104,they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking
56,this was supposed to be good training for later life
130,as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life
135,aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup
38,harry didnt trust himself to speak
83,he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh
103,there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast
59,it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink
22,he went to have a look
76,the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water
22,he asked aunt petunia
72,her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question
34,your new school uniform she said
36,harry looked in the bowl again
47,oh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wet
35,dota be stupid snapped aunt petunia
49,im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you
60,itll look just like everyone elses when ive finished
66,harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue
186,he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high  like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably
111,dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform
134,uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table
76,they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat
64,get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper
19,make harry get it
19,get the mail harry
18,make dudley get it
44,poke him with your smelting stick dudley
59,harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail
214,three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and  a letter for harry
86,harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band
52,no one ever in his whole life had written to him
133,he had no friends no other relatives  he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back
302,yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs  privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink
18,there was no stamp
202,turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter hhurry up boy
41,shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen
44,what are you doing checking for letter bombs
28,he chuckled at his own joke
65,harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter
112,he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope
91,uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard
37,marges ill he informed aunt petunia
17,ate a funny whelk
18,said dudley suddenly
25,dad harrys got something
202,harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon
37,said harry trying to snatch it back
24,whod be writing to you
83,sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it
72,his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights
23,and it didnt stop there
59,within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge
94,dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach
57,aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line
52,for a moment it looked as though she might faint
51,she clutched her throat and made a choking noise
24,oh my goodness  vernon
111,they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room
33,dudley wasnt used to being ignored
70,he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick
44,i want to read that letter he said loudly
51,want to read it said harry furiously as its mine
97,get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope
17,harry didnt move
16,i want my letter
15,let me see it
16,demanded dudley
167,roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them
292,harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor
138,vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address  how could they possibly know where he sleeps
41,you dont think theyre watching the house
71,watching  spying  might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly
29,but what should we do vernon
18,should we write back
114,tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen
18,no he said finally
17,no well ignore it
26,if they dont get an answer
85,yes thats best we wont do anythingbut im not having one in the house petunia
81,didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense
130,that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboard
15,wheres my letter
74,said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door
17,whos writing to me
68,it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly
15,i have burned it
71,it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it
71,yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling
97,he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful
36,er  yes harry  about this cupboard
159,your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroom
19,dont ask questions
18,snapped his uncle
28,take this stuff upstairs now
262,the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom
104,it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room
45,he sat down on the bed and stared around him
36,nearly everything in here was broken
515,the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it
33,other shelves were full of books
98,they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touched
98,from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there
85,i need that room make him get outharry sighed and stretched out on the bed
52,yesterday hed have given anything to be up here
93,today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it
53,next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet
20,dudley was in shock
207,hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back
121,harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall
69,uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly
119,when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it
90,they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall
38,then he shouted theres another one
167,h potter the smallest bedroom  privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him
193,uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind
192,after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his hand
64,go to your cupboard  i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry
19,dudley  go  just go
43,harry walked round and round his new room
123,someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter
35,surely that meant theyd try again
48,and this time hed make sure they didnt fail
14,he had a plan
64,the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning
50,harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently
28,he mustnt wake the dursleys
64,he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights
120,he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first
215,his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door  harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat  something alive
133,lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face
167,uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do
96,he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea
152,harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap
53,harry could see three letters addressed in green ink
87,i want  he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes
43,uncle vernon didnt go to work that day
49,he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot
113,see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give up
33,im not sure thatll work vernon
205,oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him
57,on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry
199,as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom
36,uncle vernon stayed at home again
155,after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out
80,he hummed tiptoe through the tulipsas he worked and jumped at small noises
45,on saturday things began to get out of hand
224,twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window
188,while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor
44,who on earth wants to talk to you this badly
34,dudley asked harry in amazement
115,on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy
245,no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head
98,next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets
74,the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one
76,uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall
125,when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut
97,they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor
131,that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time
58,i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave
17,were going away
26,just pack some clothes
11,no arguments
80,he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue
133,ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway
191,dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag
13,and they drove
58,even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going
115,every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while
68,shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this
41,they didnt stop to eat or drink all day
31,by nightfall dudley was howling
45,hed never had such a bad day in his life
146,he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer
94,uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city
71,dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets
130,dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering
96,they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day
85,they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table
43,scuse me but is one of you mr h potter
59,only i got about an undred of these at the front desk
214,she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room  railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way
16,the woman stared
99,ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room
46,wouldnt it be better just to go home dear
90,aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her
53,exactly what he was looking for none of them knew
133,he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again
160,the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage
24,daddys gone mad hasnt he
49,dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon
89,uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared
19,it started to rain
42,great drops beat on the roof of the car
17,dud ley sniveled
30,its monday he told his mother
31,the great humbertos on tonight
49,i want to stay somewhere with a television
33,this reminded harry of something
179,if it was monday  and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television  then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday
158,of course his birthdays were never exactly fun  last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socks
33,still you werent eleven every day
39,uncle vernon was back and he was smiling
115,he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought
25,found the perfect place
12,everyone out
32,it was very cold outside the car
78,uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea
87,perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine
59,one thing was certain there was no television in there
27,storm forecast for tonight
57,said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together
54,and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat
150,a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below them
70,ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard
27,it was freezing in the boat
90,icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces
136,after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown house
153,the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty
26,there were only two rooms
84,uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas
88,he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up
46,could do with some of those letters now eh
20,he said cheerfully
26,he was in a very good mood
102,obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail
75,harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all
55,as night fell the promised storm blew up around them
116,spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows
115,aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa
193,she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket
74,the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on
22,harry couldnt sleep
94,he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger
91,dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight
155,the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time
149,he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now
18,five minutes to go
35,harry heard something creak outside
81,he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did
19,four minutes to go
124,maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow
19,three minutes to go
56,was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that
59,and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise
40,was the rock crumbling into the sea
33,one minute to go and hed be eleven
102,thirty seconds twenty  tennine  maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him  three twooneboom
80,the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door
40,someone was outside knocking to come in
